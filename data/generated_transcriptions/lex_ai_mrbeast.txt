The following is a conversation with MrBeast, the mastermind behind some of the most epic and popular videos ever made. And now, a quick few second mention of each sponsor. Check them out in the description, it's the best way to support this podcast. We got House of Mechadamias for a satiating and delicious snack, 8 Sleep for you guessed it, naps and better help for mental health. Choose wisely my friends. Snacks, naps or mental health. And now on to the full ad reads. As always no ads in the middle. I try to make this interesting but if you skip them please still check out our sponsors. I enjoy their stuff maybe you will too. This show is brought to you by House of Macadamias. It seems like it was just yesterday. that they became a sponsor and I became aware of their existence because before they became a sponsor they sent a giant box of delicious snacks and it seems just like it was yesterday that I ate all of those snacks over a period of a few days and Was a happier man for it this month I'm much stricter on my diet and trying to be much more responsible with my consumption of snacks. I think moderation is key for that. But in general, I think first of all, macadamia to me, I think is one of the more delicious nuts, but it is definitely the healthiest or at least one of the most healthy. I think it's pretty much the healthy. I remember when I first started keto many, many years ago, I did a bunch of research on which nuts I can and can't have. I guess if I want to be ultra low carb and everybody recommended macadamia as like the one that has all these nutrients and all that kind of stuff. I'm sure there's a lot of signs. You can look it up. I think there's like omega sevens or whatever those different kinds of It doesn't matter. The points are delicious. And the raw ingredient of the macadamia nut that house macadamias provides is just delicious. And of course they do all kinds of snacks around that. And my task whenever I do an ad read or talk to anybody like my neighbors or friends about house macadamias is not to do any sexual innuendo. That's job number one. My brain is that of a silly person. At heart I'm still a child and I will forever remain a child. Like that Tom Waite song. I don't want to grow up. Maybe that's not even the name of the song or the lyrics but I'm just gonna go with it. And there's a good chance to mention that Tom Waite is somebody that I've dreamed of talking to on this podcast for a long time. He's a very difficult interview to get. He's dropped a few crumbs to me of hope, you know, saying like, yes, maybe one day. So I hold on to that hope, like a hold on to the delicious house of academia nuts with childlike joy in my eyes.

There's been a few days over the past let's say three weeks where I've been extremely stressed because of several things going on in my life you know you know how life is it's an and down process both the ups and downs contribute to the beauty of the whole experience. Anyway when things were kind of difficult I saw an escape in friends, in books, in moments of simple joy, in moments of peace and I think the best escape is a good nap. A full night's sleep, of course, but also a good nap. It's kind of magical how much your mind can just Become completely refreshed The beauty of the world can be richly rediscovered through the process of a nap. It's incredible just 20 30 minutes. It's it's kind of amazing at least my brain is like that. So sometimes when I'm feeling feeling crappy. I'll just give it a nap. I'll give it a good night's sleep and see how I feel again in the morning. Almost always, if not right away, just maybe a couple of times. I feel better. Anyway, that's why you want to really make sure that the surface, the mattress, all kinds of technology that you surround yourself with in terms of sleep, you use the best stuff. And that's That's why I look forward to sleeping on that cool surface that an A-Sleep cover provides. It's just incredible. I look forward to Napsun Sleeps just because of that A-Sleep cover.

I think it's interesting, you know, the kind of rollercoaster your mind can go on. At least my mind can go on. One moment I feel blissful and happy and everything is beautiful and one moment I feel cranky and just a little bit down. And one of the things I've learned is to just kind of allow the passage of time to cure all things. But I think that's not necessarily the full picture because you should probably treat your mental health very seriously and talk through it with the therapist. You know, there's some deep ocean of feeling there that may lay unexplored and it's I think beneficial to explore it with a good therapist. I think one of the most accessible easiest ways to get access to a good therapist, a licensed professional therapist, is better help. That's why I'm a big supporter of what they do. I mean that's really the first barrier is make it super easy and of course make it affordable and that's what BetterHelp does. Check them out at betterhelp.com slash Lex and save on your first month.

I'm here with Mr. Beast the brilliant mastermind behind some of the most popular videos ever created Do you think you'll ever make a video that gets 1 billion views? I think maybe one of the videos we've already made might get a billion views Which one do you think? Probably like the squid game video with enough time It's only a year old and it's already on 300 million or some of the newer ones we've done I've gotten like a hundred million views in a month So those four projected over ten years because YouTube's not going anywhere probably one of those so over time They don't necessarily plateau. It's interesting. We were literally jumping around. I love it. It's good So I I'm a firm believer that it's much easier to hypothetically get 10 million views on one video than a hundred 100,000 on 100. And part of why it's much easier, in my opinion, is like, if you make a really good video, it's just so evergreen and it never dies. Because YouTube, when you open up YouTube and look at the videos, they're just serving you whatever they think you'll like the best, you know? And so if you just make a great video, and it's constantly just above every other video, you know, even two years down the road, then they'll just keep serving it and never stop, you know, which is why it's much easier. easier to make one great video than a bunch of mediocre ones. What about 1 billion subscribers? You've passed Pewdiepie's the most subscribed to YouTube channel. When do you think you get a billion? Let me do some math real quick. So we're on 120. So you think about this? No, I don't honestly. I because one thing you'll find if you want to gain subscribers, if you want to get views, if you want to make money, any almost any metric In this video creation space if you want something it all comes back to okay well then just make great videos so instead of like focusing on all these arbitrary vanity metrics. I just kind of focus on the one thing that gets me all that which is make good videos but and i do think we will when they hit a billion subscribers i don't have a plan on going anywhere even though we're only on 120 million right now on the main channel i think like we're doing around 10 million a month now and. Um, YouTube just yeah, I just don't see it going anywhere and I don't see any reason why I'd ever get burnt out or quit So I think with enough time. Yes. I wanted to ask you those family friendly questions before I go to the dark questions So now we have dark questions right now, but if you wanted to hook them you would start off with the dark question That's how you get them. Okay. Well, let me ask you about the a Twitter poll you posted a ten thousand dollar death poll You tweeted if someone offered you $10,000, but if you take it a random person on earth dies Would you take the $10,000 and 45% of people said yes, that's at least at the time I checked 850,000 people committing murder for just 8.5 billion dollars in total So what do you learn about human nature from that? That's a good question. Honestly, this is like late at night when I threw that up too. I was just like, huh, this will be a funny thing. I assumed it'd be 90% no and like 10% yes. But there are a lot of serious people for you guys listening. I just did this random Twitter poll. I was like, would you take 10 grand if it meant someone random in the world died? And a lot of the replies on the suite were like, hell yeah, why not? And I was just not expecting that. And so I don't really know. I mean, I feel like your take would be better than mine. Was it disturbing to you, surprising to you? A little bit, yeah. But obviously a lot of people were trolling, but you read through those replies. I do think like 10% of them were like dead serious. Well, I think sometimes the trolling and the laws reveal a thing we're too embarrassed to admit about the darker aspects of our nature. So I don't know if you listened to Dan Carlin's Hardcore History podcast. He has a episode on painful attainment, which he describes throughout history, how humans have been really attracted to watching the suffering of others. So public executions, all that kind of stuff. And he believes that's in all of us, that for example, if something like a YouTube or a different platform, streamed a public execution or streamed the torture of another human being a lot of people would say that's deeply unethical but they will still tune in and watch and that were were attracted to that drama and especially the most extreme versions of the drama and so I think part of the laws reveal something that's actually true in that Paul that like Your answer is so much better than mine. Do you think about that maybe even with the squid game? Like so I think how many do you how many views does the squid game currently have 300 million something like this? So Just imagine Thought experiment how many views that video would get if it was like real yeah, it's giving YouTube is like, ah We'll turn a blind eye. We won't take it down. Yeah, I mean it obviously probably have billions of views How do you think you will die and do you think it'll be during a video? Probably doing something dumb like going to space when I'm in the older like trying to go to Mars or something like that I know for a fact it won't be on a video every video we do with safety experts and stuff like that so it's not really risk but Yeah, I could see myself like you know after a million million people go to Mars or something like that, I'd probably be like, you know what, let's go. And something like that maybe. So not in the name of a video, just for the helmet. Heck no. Are you open to taking risks when you shoot videos? You just went to Antarctica. I mean, you're putting yourself in the line a little bit, right? Of course, but you know, we had that video on the works for three years and then we consult with tons of experts, radar, the entire path we're going to walk beforehand to see if there's crevasses. So we know there's no Rosses, we do training, we consult experts and we have survival guides there with us and monitor the weather and everything. So it's like any variable where we could get harmed, we just pre-planned for it. Same thing with Buried Alive. David Blaine spent a week underground. And so I consulted with him and consulted with basically anyone who ever buried themselves alive. The coffin we used to bury me, we did so many tests. That coffin was buried 10 times before I was, you know, for a really longer than 50 hours, it tested the airflow and everything to the point where I was safer in that coffin underground than I was above ground. Like, so we just tend to just not leave anything up to chance, you know. Another strange question then. So you recorded these videos to yourself, you know, five years, 10 years from now. Have you recorded a video that's to be released once you die? Well, first off, I am just glad that not every one of your questions have to do with like views or things like that. It's nice getting different questions. So this is, this is good. Um, no, seriously, it's a little, but it's, it's fine because a lot of people just be like, how much money you make, you know, just something I just, everything's always about money now for when people talk to me. So it's nice. Um, but for the videos I've made, uh, for you guys who probably don't follow me too closely. When I had 8,000 subscribers and I was a teenager, I filmed a bunch of videos and scheduled them years in the future. And I said, I'd film one where I was like, hi me in a year. And the video went up a year later. And it was just like, Hey, I think you'll have 100,000 subscribers. And then I did one where I was like, hi me in five years. I was like, Hey, in five years, I think you'll have a million. And then one that hasn't come out yet, but comes out in two years is was high me in 10 years. And I try to predict 10 years later, how many subs I'd have. So he's referring to and yes, there are some that are scheduled like 20 years in the future. And so if I don't dial just move them up. And I remember because I filmed these though, like seven years ago, but it was, I remember saying a line like, you know, if I'm dead, then I'm currently just in a coffin and like, whatever, blah, blah, blah. And because the only way the video would go up is if I'm not alive and if I'm not alive, I won't be able to push back the schedule upload date, so go public automatically. Yes. And so, yeah, I have a couple of those. If I knew I was going to die of like cancer or something and I had like three months to live, I would vlog every day. I filmed so many videos and then I would just schedule upload a video a week for like the next five years. So it's like I'm still alive and I would completely act like I'm still alive and everything. And I think something like that would be cool. I don't know why but I fantasize about not fantasize but I've dreamt about that a lot like I don't know if I only had 30 days to live what would I do and for me I would try to make like a decades worth of content and schedule upload it so they automatically go public in the future and so it's just like I never died I'm just there yeah it's a kind of immortality but it's also a kind of troll on the concept of time yeah that you can die in the physical space but persist in the digital space. I actually, I recorded a video like that because I had some concerns and I just thought it's also a good exercise to do. A video would like to be released if I die. And it was actually a really interesting exercise. It's cool. Like it shows like what you really care about. I guess it's like writing a will. But when you're younger, you don't think about that kind of stuff. Exactly. Mine was just dumb. Yeah. I'm bones at a coffin. Yours is probably so serious. No, it's fun actually. What you realize is like there's no point to be serious at this point. It's a weird thing. I guess you've done this, but it's a weird thing to address the world when you the physically use no longer there. So like, you know, this would only be released if you're no longer there. Exactly. That's a weird exercise. You know, it's funny of all the people listening to this. Yeah, you know, we're probably the only only two people that have made videos for when we die. It's like such a niche thing and the fact that we're bonding over it's kind of funny. I think people should think about doing that. It's not just about YouTube, it's also social media. Just think about it. Like there's going to be a last tweet and a last, I don't know, Facebook post, a last Instagram post. And yeah, I feel like there's some aspect that's A meditative to just even considering making a post like that and also it's a way for your the people that love you to kind of Like celebrate do you think that would help them cope or not? Like if someone randomly watching this did film a video You know for if they accidentally dine some freak accident through given to their family Do you think that would and it was like a genuine? I think it would really help I mean it depends because like how would you even intro that like hey mom? If you're seeing this, you know, it means I'm probably dead. Yeah, exactly. That's how you went right? Yeah, I guess yeah, and I guess you could say in a kind of funny way but and just talk about the things that mean a lot to you because otherwise you're at the risk of the last post you have is like Like I don't know talking shit about like Donald's dead that's it hundred years I don't know this I do recommend it's it's a like the Stoics meditate on death every day in the same way you kind of Meditate on your death when you make a video like that because it's actually not just even talking to yourself It's talking to the world and it like for some reason at least for me They made it very concrete that there's going to be an end and I'm like It's almost it's over for me me. If I'm making the video, it's over for me. It's an interesting thought experiment. I recommend people try it. Okay. Are you afraid of death, by the way? Yes. It's hard because what if you just die and then you just see nothing forever? Yeah, the nothingness. It just fades to blackness and you're just like that for trillions upon trillions to billions squared years and it's scary. But also, before you're born, you don't remember those X amount of years either. So that gives me a little comfort. But it's definitely very scary. Something I'd rather not think about until I'm like 80. I'll deal with that problem then. I don't know if I told you this, but I'm kind of hopeful that someone like Elon or one of these freak smart people will just be like, you know what, screw it. I'm going to figure out a way where we can slow down aging, get it where we can live to be 200, 300 years old and just set their sights on that and then just kind of save us. So it'd be really nice. It's almost absurd to think that in our lifetime, they won't figure out a way to just even slightly slow down aging where we could live to be like 120 or 130. And then that extra time, they won't figure out somewhere where we could live to be 200. Obviously not immortal, but I don't see how In my lifetime, the life expectancy doesn't just expand. Well, it also could be that the immortality is achieved in the digital realm. Like it could be long after you're gone as a Mr. Beast run by a Chad GPT type system. Exactly. Yeah, that consumes everything I ever said, everything I ever wrote and I don't want that. I want to live. What do you smart people out there figure it out? I'll keep you entertained, but I need you to figure out how to keep me alive. Give me till 200 that will make me happy Well, that's that's funny who owns the identity of mr. Beast once the physical body is gone Like our is it illegal to create another mr. Beast? That's Chad GPT based. I don't know what the laws are on that. Yeah, like once I'm dead. I don't care Well, but you just said you did come in there could be a AI like many mr. Beast that are created after your after you're gone. Yeah, I mean that'd be cool to be able to like train up a model and let them lose so my content lives on I guess. Yeah. Yeah, but somehow feels like it diminishes the value contribute. Yeah, it's an authentic but it's also there's some aspect to the finiteness of the art being necessary for its greatness. Yeah, the second I think starts spamming out videos. Yeah. The videos lose all meaning and it's pointless and it's a money grab If you run YouTube for uh, how long should you run it for a year? How would you change it? How would you improve it? It's hard because you know, obviously I'm biased because we're doing really well But I feel like when I open up YouTube on my television, I get the videos I want to watch I don't I don't know I don't I don't ever open them and wonder like what are they? these, what are these 10 videos on my homepage? When I click on a video, my sister says, I don't ever wonder what these are. Like I, I, and maybe it's cause I'm very adamant about like the kind of videos I watch and I try not to watch videos that I want to get recommended more because I just, that's how I think, but I'm very happy with how it is at the moment. I think one thing though that I just hate with the passion is the comment section on YouTube. It's just so bad. Um, but that, I know that's not something that's going to 10x the growth of the platform. But if you think about it, you go to Reddit to read comments and somehow like that, you know, usually the top 20 posts on a popular Reddit post are not spam. You know what I mean? Like, have you ever clicked on something on the front page of Reddit? And then most of voted replied to it is like, go check out my site right here. And it's like trying to scam you out of $1,000. Yeah, I can't even think of one instance I've ever had that happen. So So like Reddit, it's so nice to click on posts and just see what people have to say. And I almost wish like you had that same feeling when you read the comments on a YouTube video. Instead, it's like, it's so many people just copy and pasting so many bots that just grab the top comment for your previous video and paste it over. So top comments and every videos are the same. And the things that break through that are just scammers trying to get you to give them $1,000 for a free, you know, fake ad that comments section is one of the most lively on the internet. So it would be amazing if YouTube invested in creating a natural community like where people could do high effort comments and be rewarded for it like on Reddit. Yeah, like actually right out along that would make me so happy because like when I upload a video, I usually go to Twitter to see feedback. Like I read my comments and I'll flip through newest but it's just I feel like Reddit and Twitter just give me so much better filtered feedback, especially now that with Twitter blue because people pay $8 a month. I've noticed any tweets I get from verified users now, they're usually not just garbage troll takes. These are people paying $8 a month. They're usually relatively sensible. It's been pretty nice. After I upload a video, I just go on the verified tab on Twitter and just see what people have to say. Anyways, I live for the day that YouTube's like that. What do you think about Twitter? What do you think about all the? Fun activity happening recently since Elon. Yeah, I bought Twitter. I think you should make me CEO like I tweeted Well, I should I should say sort of we had we just like a couple hours ago had a conversation with Elon and I You guys said exchange of some excellent ideas. So yeah, I I'd legitimately think obviously you're exceptionally busy But I legitimately think you'll be awesome if you somehow participate in the future of Twitter Yeah, it would be fun because there's so much possibility of different ideas first in the sort of the The content like dissemination hosting and all the different recommendations like the search and discovery all the things that YouTube does well I think the most exciting exciting thing is he's willing to move fast. And so I think there's going to be a lot of interesting things that come out of it because he's just moving quick. And a lot of these more mature platforms just take years to do the simplest stuff. And they're very bureaucratic. And so it's going to, I mean, it'll be interesting to see which way it goes when you just kind of take a move, quick, break things, whatever type approach to social media. I'm actually pretty curious to see what features he rolls out. So what would be your first act as Twitter CEO? I can't spoil it. Okay. I gotta get hired. What do you think about video on the platform? Twitter? Yeah, do you think that's an interesting or is it like messing with the medium, the nature of the platform? I think Twitter will always be closer to TikTok than it is to YouTube. Like at least in this for him. I don't see 20 minute, one hour long videos or whatever, even 15 minute videos being watched over there. I see it more as like the short and snappy stuff closer to TikTok. But at the same time, Twitter is a really good comment section for the internet. I mean, it's almost weird why. Why doesn't Twitter allow you to embed YouTube videos? You should just ask Elon that like I don't know if that's a YouTube thing but when a youtuber posts a video why do they have to link to YouTube why can't they just embed it on Twitter and you just play it there I mean wouldn't that just solve a lot of problems yeah but then the two companies that have to agree to integrate each other's content I don't know but it seems like a win-win I mean well it's more of a win for Twitter because then people don't have to leave the platform I mean that'd be the the easiest but who gets like when you watch the ads on a YouTube video that That's embedded in Twitter who gets the money it would still be YouTube But at least then right now people just post the link and it takes you off Twitter and it just kills your session time on Twitter That's really interesting, but that yeah because the Twitter whatever the The dynamics of the comments especially once the spam bots are taken care of Twitter just works. It's really nice So reddit is a nice comment section from the internet. It's like slower pace more deliberate like higher average for Twitter's like this high-paced, like ephemeral kind of stream, but there's the vote, the upvoting, the downvoting works much better because you can do retweeting, right? Because the social network is much stronger than it is on YouTube. Like the interconnectivity. Yeah, on Reddit, you're going to get the top replies are going to be the most refined ones, whereas Twitter stuff flows to the top. That's not super refined. But like you're saying, it's more off the cuff streaming consciousness, which a lot of people prefer because it's a little more personal. How do you think Twitter compares to YouTube in terms of how you see its future on Rollin 2023? I mean, I think YouTube's going to be YouTube and not much is really going to change, but it's going to keep growing just because that's just what it does because it's owned by Google. But Twitter, I don't know. I mean, it's one of those things like you You can't predict if like, you know a year from now an economy is gonna be in a recession or booming and I think Twitter's kind of the same thing One thing's for certain a lot of things are gonna be rolled out, but who knows Honestly you responded to Elon saying Twitter's unlikely to be able to pay creators more money than YouTube What do you think that is? Well, yeah, cuz I think the tweet I responded to is one where he was saying that they users will jump over if Twitter can potentially pay more than other platforms. I was just saying, obviously, because Google has Google AdWords, and that's Google's whole thing. It's putting ads on stuff. They've been doing it better than anyone else in the world for a very long time. It's very unlikely in the next few years that Twitter is going to just magically or any platform give a creator the ability to make higher CPMs than on YouTube. It's kind of crazy. Like some creators in December, you know Q4 because ad rates are higher because of Christmas and everything some creators literally make like 30 $40 per thousand views and that's after YouTube's cut like it's almost like hard to think about like how high the RPMs get and even then once you pull out of finance and cars the high CPM niches and you move into just normal stuff It's still just crazy. They're sure volume of creators and the fact that all of them get these multi-dollar CDs PMS at scale. It's pretty beautiful. So you do, I don't know what you would call them, but like integrated ads in your videos and you do, I would say masterfully, it's like part of the, you're talking about brand deals, brand deals, is that what you would call that? Yeah. So it's a brand deal. It's part of the video. It's still really exciting to watch. And yet there's a plug for the brand in general, just brand deals since you brought it up, integrating them well. I think that something a lot of creators don't do, they'll just do a brand deal out of the blue. They'll just be filming a video and then around the three-minute mark just start talking about a random company. And I feel like if you don't want viewers to click away and you want people to not get pissed off and call you to sell out, you got to find a way to integrate into content. And ideally, use the money in the video to make it better. The easiest thing you do when you do a brand deal is just tell people how you're using money from the brand deal to make your content better. If you do that, no one cares. Now they're supporting you for it. And you go from being a sellout to like, oh, I'm doing this to make better videos for you guys. You know, I don't know if you can share, but with those brands, when you have discussions with them, are they strict about how long you need to be talking about it? Or is it more about their leaving control to you about the artistic element of it? The problem is the ones who don't give us artistic element, we just don't really work with anymore. Because it's just, you know, we get 100 million views of video now. And I can confidently say, I know how to entertain them and convert them better than these random brands. So, yeah, if they don't give us that freedom, I just won't work with them. So you have that leverage before smaller creators, it's a lot harder. Yeah. And they're, they're going to just say 45 seconds. Here's what you say, take it leave it and it's like pretty brutal because I think just in general if brands were more accommodating to let creators tell their story of the brand and talk about the brand in a way that felt a little more natural. I think it would be less cringe. People would be less likely to go, you know, tap, tap, tap, skip and obviously it would convert better but they're just so afraid and they want this standardized thing. Say these words and 45 seconds right here at this three-minute mark. Yeah, I often think about how to resist that. You just don't do them though, right? Not on YouTube, right? On audio, I do ads in the very beginning and I say you can skip them if you want. The brand loves that. The point is they... So the funny thing about podcasts is different than YouTube videos. Podcasts, people actually do listen to add a lot because it's slower paced and they like the the creator voice like talking about the thing. But in general, I just don't believe you should be talking about a thing for a minute exactly and that's going to be effective. I want to see the data for that. I think what's much more effective is the way you do ads, which is like integrating to the content, like put a lot of effort into making a part of that, like doing the brand deals. I just it's difficult to have that conversation. It's like a very Strenuous conversation you have to have with with brands after each one at a time and I just wish there was more of a culture to say like the quality of the ad read matters a lot more than the like the silly parameters like the timing of it like how long it is the placement of it all that kind of stuff. What percentage of your viewers do you think have seen one of my videos before? What percentage of the viewers on YouTube, right? Yeah, of your viewers. Of the viewers on YouTube, though. Yes, yeah. Most of the people. Okay, sure. Or all of them. It's just interesting because you're speaking very specifically about my brand deal process. And so in my head, I'm like, I wonder what percentage of these people even have any idea what he's talking about. That's interesting. I love the thinking about number The whole time we're having this conversation. It's all I could think about. It's like God damn it. He's there's probably like 50% of these people have no fucking clue what he's saying and we're about to torture him for five minutes Yeah, yeah, probably but that's something I can't turn off in my brain less less than 50% Is that a good thing or a bad thing? Is that exciting to you that there's like 50% of people don't have not watched the mr. Beast video. Isn't that an opportunity? Yeah, I guess it's an opportunity girl. I don't know honestly I was just kind of excited to hang out with you. Yeah, me too. Today was a lot of fun. Who cares are the mics? Yeah, so it was kind of like having a buddy to go along the journey as I'm just kind of eating shit and doing my normal grind. It was like kind of fun. And also you just say really wise stuff constantly. Honestly, no, I never even put any thought into like that demographics or what I could gain. It's just interesting because like my retention brain, when you talk about something, I'm instantly like, hmm, What value are they gonna get how many of them are gonna be interested what percentage of people do I think will lose and I'm like running all those calculations of background and that whole conversation like the lock is just something I can't turn off my like bells are like air air This is bad. What are the different strategies for high retention for your videos and in general? It's like how do you cook good food? You know, I mean that's like the same kind of question. I see so there's so many different different ways that you're so it boils down to I mean do you think it's at the level of a story or do you think like literally watching five seconds at a time am I gonna tune out here I'm gonna tune out here I'm gonna tune out here it's all of it you need the overarching narrative and then you also need the micro where every second you know needs to be entertaining and you basically what's interesting is the longer people watch something the more likely they are to keep watching. So you don't have to try as hard in the hypothetically back half of a video as you do in the front. Like even right now, we're so deep into this where a lot of people listening are probably just going to keep listening relatively close to the end unless we just have a really boring part of this conversation because they're just they're saying it they're they're immersed. And so a big like to really boil it down to a simple level you just to get people where they're immersed in the content and then just kind of hold them there. We had this discussion offline and by the way I should mention that this is like late at night. It is. What time is it? It's nine o'clock. And I only slept one hour last night because I'm an idiot and I flew to the wrong location. Well here we're like hey let's just book you a hotel to fly. He's like no I got it. We're like you sure? We just do it. We always do this. He's like, no, I got it. I got it. You're gonna have to rub it in. I know. And then today, coming to find out, he flew to the wrong airport. Airport with the, or a city with a similar name to ours. Just same name. Same name in a different state. And I was like, that's why you should have let us book it. And so he's on one hour of sleep and he's literally been dying all day. Before the podcast, he downed like two things, coffee. We've been going all day hard. Yeah, been getting directly I should say that this gave me an opportunity to I got a Ride from a stranger and it was an incredible person that I got to interact with them So it's like there's so many kind people around here Just like this kind of southern energy and then I got to go to a diner because I could you know There's only one hour between me arriving and having to fly out so I went to diners. There's a really kind Waitress that called me honey. So that's a beautiful moment, you know I was so confused you tweeted about that and I steals like Lex my assistant was like Lex isn't here yet And I saw your tweet. I was like he's here. Yeah, feels like no He's still flying. I was like for like an hour ago. He just tweeted about a nice diner Yeah, it was a diner. It was a diner in a different state and then you had to fly over here. Yeah And then I called you didn't answer I was like something's not add enough Yeah, I feel like a session idiot because apparently the world Has cities like Springfield right? Like this like every single state has a Springfield. Oh really? I think so. I think that's a whatever. That's like a Simpsons joke, right that like it's the city and and the Simpsons the Springfield and I think every single state or most of them have a spring field and the same is true for like Georgetown I think almost pop I forget what the most popular one was but there's like a list of the people get when they run out of ideas they just keep you I got to I got to meet a bunch of people from From your team is just an incredible human beings it so let me just ask on that topic. How do you higher-grade team. What have you learned about hiring for everything? For the main channel that you do, for the React, the gaming channel, to MrBeastBurger, to Feastables, all that. The big thing is, especially in this content creation, because it's not like anything that's done on Netflix or different content medians, I really need people who are coachable and really see the value in what I care about because it's a very specific way of going about things. There's no one to plug and play. If Netflix wanted to hire someone to do a documentary, there's probably tens of thousands of people you could hire that have worked on documentaries before. But if you want to hire someone to make super viral YouTube videos like we do, there's just no one you you can really pull from. Sometimes I'll hire people from game shows. They have all these preconceived notions about pacing and how a video should be. And you have to spend the first year breaking all these habits. And they think they're better than you. A lot of people in traditional think they're better. And they think their way is better than what we do. And so for me, it's almost easier to hire people that are just hard workers that are obsessed and really coachable and just train them how to like be good at content creation and production than to hire someone from like traditional, which is the only way to really do it because there's not that many YouTube channels that have scaled up. So it's not like there's a huge talent pool of people who've worked on YouTube channels. So it's easier just to train someone than just pull them from traditional because traditional people just, I don't know, they have all these opinions and things and they just think our way of going about things is dumb. Yeah. Yeah, so you want people who have the humility to have a beginner's mind even if they have experience. And see the value. Like actually, you'll still get it. It's so crazy. Like especially some of my other friends that are skinned up through YouTube channels, there's people that will come on and you'll ask them, like, what do you want to be doing in five years? And instead of saying, oh, I want to be working on this channel, they'll be like, oh, I hope to be working on movies or this and they see like working on a YouTube channel as a launchpad to go into traditional. And it's like, no, like you just don't get it. This is the future. This is the end goal. This is your career. And so I'm just so tired of having those kinds of conversations. Like I feel like people really should be coming around. Are there like recurring interview questions that you ask? Is there ways to get? Yeah, the biggest thing is like, what do you want to be doing in 10 years? And their answer isn't, you know, making content on YouTube or, you know, if their answer is anything like movies or stuff like that, it's like just a hell no. Like it just won't even remotely work. So you really want people to believe in the vision of YouTube? Yeah, I mean, ideally it's like, oh, working here, you know what I mean? So it's less about the medium and more about just being on a great team is doing epic stuff. Yeah, well, and yeah, the media as well, because those it's just it's hard to put into words, but there's it's just two completely different ways of going about things, you know, like our videos aren't scripted and you know it's a lot more run and gun and when we if we hypothetically blow up a giant car or whatever like you only have one take you know it's a and it's not scripted and so you have to over film overshoot things over compensate for like the dumb way of going about it a lot of traditional people would be like well just plan what you're gonna say and just plan the angles you can cut the cameras in half you can save 50 grand here you can save a you know 70$35,000 editing. There's not that, and it's like, yeah, but that's not authentic. That's, you know, blah, blah. You get it. It's almost so obvious that it hurts that I have to like constantly have these conversations, but that's what we live in. But there's also a detail like there's a taste. Like I've watched a bunch of videos with you and it's clear to you that you've gotten really good. I don't know what the right word is, style or taste to be able to know what's good and not in terms of attention in terms of just stylistically visually. I don't have to think. I can just watch a video and it just screams in my head like this is what should change based on the million videos I've watched and all these viral videos I've consumed. This is blah blah blah what's optimal and things like that. It's almost like your brain's like a neural net and if you consume enough viral videos and enough Good content that you just kind of start to like train your brain to like see it and see these patterns that happen in all these viral videos and so that anytime I watch a video or a movie or anything I just can't stop thinking about what is optimal and so it's like it gives me a headache sometimes when I watch something too slow or I don't think is optimal obviously my taste is at the end all be all But that's something that kind of torments me if that makes any sense. Oh you can't and No, I can't. And that's not to say there's a... Your attention on the godfather is horrible. Yeah, no, exactly. I've tried to watch that movie like three times. But that's not to say slow movies are bad. Like, there's an audience for it. It's just obviously not what I've trained my brain to like in social media and YouTube right now. Like, there's just not the meta. And in general, like you said, in neural network, you're training your brain in part on actual data. Right. So you're actually data driven. So you're looking at like in terms of thumbnails and titles and different aspects of the first 5, 10 seconds and then throughout the video, the retention, all that you're looking at all of that for your own videos to understand how to do it better. So that's where the neural network is training. Yeah. Basically, there are ways you can kind of see like the most few videos on YouTube every day and stuff like that. I just kind consume those every school day. I've been doing that for way too many years. And then you just start to notice patterns. Like the thumbnails on the most few videos or videos that go super viral tend to be clear, tend to not have much clutter, tend to be pretty simple. Titles tend to be less than 50 characters. Intros tend to be this. Stories tend to be this. And you just kind of like, after you see those thousands and then tens of thousands of time, it just starts to click in your head. Like, this is what it looks like, you know? So how are you able to transfer that taste that you've developed to the team? So for like, because you said like broad things, but I'm sure there's a million detailed things like what zoom to use on the face using the thumbnail, right? Like the answer is whatever makes the best video because the problem is the more I have so many friends who are like this, they'll make like checklists for their editors. So like, you know, this be in this be and you need to have like a three-part arc and then this. But the problem is that's how you, the more constraints you put on the team, the more repetitive and less innovation you get. And the more like, you know, after 10 videos, people are going to be like, all right, I've already seen this. So to me, and I'm 24, and you know, I'm probably my mindset will change over the next 10 years. I just haven't been in this industry too long. But the only way to like really make innovative content and keep things fresh is to not put constraints on or put as little as possible. And so that's why I'm very hesitant about all that stuff because the more I say the more they're gonna be like, Oh, then that's what we do. And then, you know, I'll say one time like, Oh, you know, ideally there's a cut every three seconds. And the next thing you know, every video, there's like cut every three seconds or whatever. So it's, it's hard because I try to give as little train not training but as little facts or as possible and more just make suggestions if that makes any you mean publicly or to your team to my team yeah what was so we talked about sort of teaching your voice or yours style whatever we want to call it to other people on the team so they can be kind of a mr. beast replacement so what's the process of teaching that so you don't want to No, I got you. You're more talking about like what I would call almost like cloning, right? Like Tyler and other people like that. Yeah. So when we were hanging out today, I was showing him how we have multiple people in the company. It's almost like talking to the camera to have it. Yeah, you turn slowly to the camera. I was like, it is, have it. Is it weird to you to not be looking at the camera? This whole interview, I constantly have been turning towards the camera like I'm talking to him. I have it because my whole life I've just been talking to a camera. Who are you thinking about when you look at the camera? Do you like imagine somebody? I'm fully thinking about the person just sitting watching it and I almost it's weird when I'm looking at the camera. I don't see a camera I'm like in a haze picturing what the viewer is seeing when they watch it. Yeah, that makes sense And that's where I'll be saying things and I'm doing something and then like what I'm watching, I'm like, that's not what I want. And then I'll freeze up. It's very weird when I'm filming. And for people who haven't worked with me too much, they'll think like, I don't know, it's very weird, like how I go about it, because I'll just be doing whatever, like lighting a firework. This is a thousand dollar firework. I'll go to light and I'll like freeze because in my head, I'm like, this, I don't know, I don't like how that flow or how that shot looks because I, it's weird. I can perfectly picture what I'm filming by just at the camera and then putting myself through the lens of the camera while making content. I can do it at the same time. So you're like real time editing the video. Yeah, that's something that didn't at the start come natural to me, but in the last probably like five years it's happened. And so I would say it's one of my greatest strengths, but I don't know how I developed it. But anytime I'm filming anything, like it's almost like the right side of my brain, I just can just look at and I see exactly what I'm filming and I can just picture it. Well, it's probably recording the video, being the talent for the video and then watching the editing and like analyzing it carefully and do that over and over and over. Yeah, you do that. You develop. Ten thousand times, yeah. You do the editing more than being in front of the camera. So like you start to see yourself from that third person perspective. Exactly. And then maybe that actually helps with the nerves of it too. Like you see it as creating a video versus performing. Right? Yeah. Yeah. I think so. You know, it's weird. I've never been nervous talking to a camera. It's harder for me to talk to a person than to talk to a camera, which I feel like a lot of people say that though, that are whatever make content, right? Interesting. I've heard that so many times. Or maybe not. Maybe I'm just awkward and dumb. Maybe they're practiced. To me, it's, I mean, both are terrifying but being in front of the camera by yourself is much easier. Really? Yeah, so much easier. I prefer to million times over. But that's my whole life. It's just that's why it's interesting. Like you spent more of your time talking to people. It comes natural and I talked to a piece of plastic. Oh, yeah, I guess you're talking to a person too. There's just then on the other side of the camera. Yeah, there's just a pixel on the screen. So, so How do you achieve that? Oh, yeah, that's right. That's all rabbit show So I was showing him that I have a lot of people in the company who are able to think like me and Basically make decisions like I would make if I was like if you were asked Hey in this video should we climb a mountain or should we dig a hole? Yeah, right? And like, you know, they would pick the same answer I'd pick 90 plus percent of the times and so like one example is Tyler who I was showing you when he was pitching some content. You could see it. He was on point. Basically, for just four or five years, we just spent an absurd amount of time together and worked on every single video together. We worked side by side. Same thing with my CEO, James. He literally lived with me for a couple of years. I'm a big fan of just finding people who are super obsessed and all-in and A players that You know they really just want to be great and they're just dumping everything I have in them and like you were saying because I'd love to find that and develop that you're saying you're basically for a Long time just said everything you were thinking to them exactly like James the guy who's basically my right him and right now For two years he lived with me and we probably talked on average of those two years seven hours a day and anytime I had a phone call at dawn on speaker and I'd let him listen at anything I was reading any content I was consuming like really just training his brain to think like me so that way He could just do things without my input without me having to constantly watch over him or give him advice and and that's where we've gotten like so for the first six months He didn't do anything. He just studied me and studied everything I cared about and how I spoke and blah blah and then the next six months He started taking on some responsibilities And now he can just run the company and you know, I don't ever really have to check it on him like most of the decisions he makes are exactly what I would do And so I don't I call that cloning I don't know what other people would but it's just like finding people that are really obsessed and they just kind of really want it and just being like giving them an avenue to like Get it if that makes any sense another way to see it is you're converging towards a common vision and that makes like brainstorming much more productive. Yeah, it just makes it where I don't have to be so involved in everything because I just have these people I know will think like I will, at least relatively close to it. So I can kind of almost be in multiple places at once per se. And so these things that, you know, I still approve every idea we film and, you know, everything before we film and all the creative, I approve it, but I don't have to like be in the weeds and nuances and do all this minor stuff. I can just let them handle it. I can just do the more macro things. I got a chance to sit in to a lengthy brainstorming session with Tyler and others. That was really cool. Can you talk about the process of that? Of people pitching ideas and you pitching alternatives or shutting down ideas ideas and just going like plowing through ideas very I mean you kind of just described exactly what we did yeah I mean but the ideas are really really good it's just tossing out like different categories of ideas and then also fine-tuning them to see like how I change like thinking about the titles and the song I work so well off inspiration it's like that's a something like give me any word. I don't know. Make a relative space. Yeah, like I went to space, you know, what happens if you blow up a nuke in space or I went to the moon, I went to Mars, right? Because you said that one word, it was able to inspire me to come up with four ideas. And so that's just, it's for me, if you, the way to get 100 million views on videos, you need something original, creative, something people really need to see, ideally never been done before, all these like things and so you need like if you want to consistently go super route you need just a constant stream of ideas and the only way I've really found that I can consistently come up with 100 million view videos is to intake inspiration and then see what my brain outputs and so that's kind of at its core foundation what I'm doing there is just like in taking a lot of random inspiration to see what spawns in my mind so I can output it but the neural network of your brain is generating the video, the title, the thumbnail, all like jointly. Exactly. And that only comes because I spent 10 years of my life just obsessively studying all that stuff. Because you, I mean, it seems like you would literally potentially shut down a video just because you can't come up with a good title or a thumbnail. Yeah, 100% or a thumbnail. Yeah. I mean, that's what happened to 70% of those in that pitch session. I was just like, Oh, what was one of them? genius versus 100 people or yeah like maybe average intelligence versus genius or something like that or yeah I was like what the heck is the thumbnail even if the title was good yeah I mean there's so many but yeah people don't click they don't watch that's so interesting but you developed over time the ability to kind of give it what what makes for a good title short not just short it's also I mean if someone reads it, do they have to watch it? Is it just so intrinsically interesting that it's just going to fuck with them if they don't click on it? So it doesn't have to be short, but it has to be like, you almost want to have a retention to word by word reading. Ideally, it's a title also that, because the titles don't live in a vacuum, right? So it has to lead into the content. So Ideally the title represents content that you would want to watch for 20 minutes So if it's a 20 minute video and the title is I stepped on a bug It's not gonna because it's all of it combined and this is the click theory is gonna be much lower than if it was like a five second video people might click it so you got a like even nuances of the length of the video based against the title will affect whether people want to click it because sometimes they just all add up I mean it's that yes, ideally you want to blow 50 characters because above 50 characters on certain devices, you run the chance of it going dot, dot, dot. So like, I took a light pole and I saw how many dollar bills I could stack on top and they would just go dot, dot, dot because it's too long and they can't finish it. And that's the worst thing because then people don't even know what they're clicking on. And so it's going to do even worse. Short, simple, ideally, and just so freaking interesting, they have to click. And it is a good segue into the content and it represents represents the length of the content. And there's probably stuff it's hard to convert into words for you. Like, I stepped on a bug versus stepping on a bug versus Mr. B stepped on a bug versus bug stepping video. So it's like, yes, the more extreme the opinion, typically the higher the click-through rate. If you can like pay it off in the content, then it just super charges it. So like, you have a kind of of the extreme. This water, right? If you're like, Fiji water sucks. Yeah, that would do fine. But if you said Fiji water, it's the worst water bottle or the worst water I've ever drank in my life. Yeah, way more extreme opinion would do way better. You have to deliver. Yeah, but then you have to deliver because the more extreme you are, the more extreme you have to be in the video. Yeah, that's almost inspiration for you to step up. Yeah, but you can be more extreme in a positive way. A lot of people, it's easier though. Positive, negative clickbait is much easier than positive clickbait. It just is. It's so much easier to get negative clicks. And so a lot of people are just, in my opinion, you know, a little bit lazier and they just take the route like, oh, well, this one gets the same amount of clicks, and it's easier, less effort. The positive one is doing a large number of numbers. of something like I spent this number of hours doing this or whatever if you just wanted to help people or right It's just harder to get 10 million views on a video helping people than it is to get 10 million views on a video tearing down a celebrity You don't mean or whatever negative video you want to insert there. Well, that said most of your videos are pretty positive. Yeah, but not a lot of people do those kinds of videos because they're hard Yeah, they're hard. Yeah, some of that is giving away money, right? Yeah, what's the secret to that? What's how do you do do that right? Yeah, like give away money or in a video that made it to make it compelling? Um, is it that so there's a number that is better than another number, right? The higher number is always better than the number. Yeah, I feel most part and you know, it's interesting like Some videos will give away a million dollars. Some videos will give away half a million. There's not really core I guess so I'm retracting what I just said I was more joking with that but there's no difference whether I put 500k or a million there's probably not even really a difference between a hundred caramillion I haven't really looked into it like some of our most few videos are not us giving away million dollars and sometimes the million dollar videos just don't do as well as the other one so either there's a certain point where a dollar amount is just a large dollar amount to an average human and so I think that point is a hundred K like anything above a hundred K The average human is just like that's a lot of money. Yeah, it doesn't it doesn't a hundred-k and a million like doesn't really move the needle and that makes sense Which that's a very nuanced piece of information that applies to very few people but yeah, well, no I think applies. It's fascinating as fast a human Our relationship with money is fascinating. I'm wise. It's so exciting to get I mean I you know the times I found like 20 bucks on the ground are like incredible. I don't know why. Why are you so happy? Like what exactly is so joyful about that? I mean, it depends where you are in life, what the situation is. Yeah, I don't know. There's also a gamified aspect to it. It's exciting. Yeah, I get it. Like why people want to see people win money. It's just interesting that past 100 grand, it doesn't really seem to make a difference. Like, It's the same basically. So you found that to be true with all the money you've given away that just didn't click through rate like obviously in terms of someone receiving it yeah a million dollars changes their life drastically more like that's the difference like oh you if you wanted to you could really quit your job as opposed to 100k is like not really you probably do like a scientific study like a formula giving away money to click through rate yeah there could be some kind of I guess It definitely the returns level off dramatically after 100k. That's basically the premise. What about 10,000? No, there's 10 100,000. It's funny because it's such a small niche thing. But yeah, 100,000 does it from what I see in our videos get more clicks than 10,000. But the difference between 100,000 million is just so little. I just I think big number big number to a lot of people. Well, I pass up Yeah, so for $100,000 you can like give an average salary you can probably live for a year given given what they have average salaries in America So that's like a big that feels yeah, I think it's also just more when they read the title. It's just like it's a lot of zeros fuck loads zeros. Okay click Yeah Man, that's fascinating. So on the thumbnail side again, that's gonna be much harder to say probably But you know offline, you know, I got a chance to look at a bunch of thumbnails and it's fascinating which ones do well which ones don't Is there something you could say about what are the elements of a thumbnail that work? Well, is this also deeply in Well, that's where yeah, it's the same thing like how do you cook good food? But I it's easier if you pull up a thumbnail and I could be like that's why that's good That's why that's bad. That's like an example would be like one of my friends. I was he just uploaded a video recently and I called him I was like what is this because he's a very very smart guy and in the thumbnail he's he's getting chased by cops but the cops were wearing yellow vests so they don't look at cops I was like oh why are the cops in your thumb wearing yellow vests it's like that makes it so much more boring and he was like carrying a flag but the pole and the color of the flag were the same color so it's like it's a little harder to see the flag as like also you're wearing like a shirt with like five different colors like so it's like it's hard to tell what even what your outline is and then in the background there are cars and I was like well if you have cops chasing you why not make the cars cop cars and you know and it's like because in my head I'm like dang if you just did those like four or five things the video probably got like seven X the views how much iteration because I also got a chance to see the number of iterations you do on a It's a problem now. That's an addiction is it so you kind of There's a lot of the versions are really good. Yeah, how do you know what does I love how you when we pulled up that the burger one and we were flipping through that's really good I was like, oh, that's version like one of like a thousand But even the sketch the idea was good like already even the original idea is yeah, yeah So one of our coming up videos, we made the world's largest plant-based burger and the thumbnail we were thinking is like me standing beside the burger because it's six feet tall. That's that's what he's talking about. So like just picture a giant six foot tall burger super wide, thousands of pounds and then I'm beside it. And then it's like eating the world's largest burger. Like you, that's just something you have to click. Like, so you were saying like, how would you describe a good thumbnail? Like that, you know what I mean? Like, but I think you said the one, I noticed first that was good where you were very small in it. Religious and you didn't like that one. I needed to come forward a little bit and also the photo we took was just my upper body. So they photo manipulated creating my legs Photoshop and that's why I said I didn't like it because my right leg was a little like off. It was like bent the wrong way. Does the physics and the thumbnail have to even make sense. I mean, you can just like exaggerate the head size and all that kind of stuff. Yeah, 100%. Yeah, things don't have to be relative. You can have a car in the background and beat three times the size. Because yeah, everyone of my thumbnails, my face is in the, you know, left side very big. So brand recognition. So just people know, oh, especially because now that a lot of people copy our videos, it's just nice to like, you know, everyone else might make thumbnails like this, but this is mine. Yeah. And obviously we usually over deliver and do bigger stuff. Would you recommend to other creators that want to make it big and they see Mr. Beast and they look up to you to copy some elements of you or to really try to be unique? Unique, 100% unique. The next Mr. Beast, quote unquote, it's weird saying that third person, but whatever, is not going to do what I'm doing better. They're going to just invent their own way. Like you're just not going to do what i do better than me you know i have so many i literally have the best people in the world working here and i i reinvest everything i make even to this day you know i mean like it's absurd the amount of money i spend on content and i don't care i'll just stop sleeping and i'll just film every other day like you're just not gonna beat me at my own game and that's fine you should it like i didn't get where i am by just beating someone else at their own game i just found my own lane and innovated and adapted and so yeah there's a lot of people that do copy me and it's fine whatever do it but just know you're not gonna get to where I am doing that. And so I'd advise you don't. You give away a lot of the secrets basically everything about how you operate. Is there a... I don't hold anything back. Go for it. How do you think about that? Because that's pretty rare. I think and this is definitely not... Most people in my stance, I don't think would take this or my position would take this stance but I see every other youtuber or person on social media even because we're also focused super heavily on YouTube but last year we're also the most followed TikTok creator in the world as well. Actually we're most subscribed to YouTube channel world and the most followed TikTok account in the world. But in general I just see everyone else as collaborators not competitors. I don't think giving advice and helping other creators do what Well, in any way harms me and I think it only brings more value to my life. How was it? Jumping on tiktok and trying to understand that platform from scratch Yeah, so from being a successful youtuber to understand it a totally different algorithm fundamentally different algorithm It's interesting. Well, not even just the algorithm just the content like I'm going from basically 15 minute short films to one sub one minute vertical content. It's a whole different different, just ballpark. And so the first little while I was doing TikTok, it was just kind of figuring out, what does Mr. V's look like in this short form content? But recently we've really started to catch our stride and come up with some original concepts and figure out how to innovate over there just like we did on YouTube because I didn't want it to just be shitty YouTube videos. And so an example is, We played the rock for a hundred K and rock paper scissors and the loser had to donate a hundred K charity we did We went to random people on a campus and we offered them so I said I'll give you a hundred dollars if you fly to Paris and give me a baguette and then they said no I was like I'll give you three hundred dollars you fly to Paris and give me a big I was expecting this person to say no and it go up to like 10 grand He's like yes, and so he flew to Paris got a baguette and brought it back again it to me. And that across everything got like 450 million views. And it, cause it's just really cool just to see this random guy get on a plane, spend a day in Paris, and we cut it up real nicely and bring it back. And so we're starting to find just tons of original content over there. But it seems like an epic video to make for one minute. Exactly. No one on short forms doing it. That's the thing. It's like, it's just so funny because like TikTok's been big for a while now, years. years. And then, you know, as we started to really figure out things on the YouTube channel and get a cranking where I have some free time, we set our sights on TikTok and like, okay, what are people not doing? How do we make it better, put in more effort, make it good? And we did the same thing we did at YouTube, just different over on TikTok and it worked. And now we're the fastest growing, or most followed TikTok account in 2022. And it's just funny that No one else did that and you're not afraid to do epic stuff, which I also during the brainstorming Some some of the ideas you're like that's better as a short That's crazy. Yeah, but can you remember one cuz I remember I said that a bunch I can't think of all I remember is that they were like epic videos Like really you're going to do that for a one-minute video. Yeah, it's crazy. So like are you posting similar content? content to a YouTube short as a TikTok? Yeah, those were just double up. It's just hard. You know, what's actually pretty fascinating in people who do social media listening to this, we'll probably find this pretty interesting is picture like the content creation meta three years ago versus now where you can make sub one minute vertical content and it go viral on TikTok and go viral on YouTube shorts, go viral on Instagram Reels, it goes viral on Facebook, it goes Reddit, you know, you through vertical content now and Twitter when you click on a video and you flip through it. So this is actually very weird. This is the first time in the history of, I guess, Western social media that one form of content could actually go super viral on every single platform. It's never been like that before. So they're going viral individual. They're not like interbreeding or whatever. I can post something on TikTok that will get 100 million views and then post on shorts and it'll get 200 million views and then post it on Instagram and it get 50 million views and then, you know, I haven't yet, but you know, you can then turn around and tweet in and get tens of millions of views and you can post on Reddit and get tens of millions of views and Facebook and get tens of millions of views. And that just wasn't a thing. Three years ago, Twitter didn't have when, because a lot of you probably don't even know this, but when you tap on a video now and you swipe down, it just turns into TikTok. That wasn't a thing even a year ago. Reddit, that wasn't a thing a year ago. Probably two years ago, that wasn't a thing on Instagram. 3 years ago, that wasn't a thing on YouTube, right? With YouTube shorts. So this is all new and I don't, it's weird. I haven't heard a single person talk about it. But this is the first time where content can actually go viral on every single platform and you don't have to write or film a video for Facebook, film a 12 minute video for YouTube, film a sub 60 second video for TikTok, write a tweet for Twitter and post this on Facebook. You can just do the same thing on every platform and the fact that your content has gone viral on multiple platforms regularly means that Virality is not accidental Sometimes it can be of course, but it's it's just not it can be engineered. It's yeah So many people say it's luck and they're like you're just lucky or this or that but What do we have to probably like a thousand videos over 10 million views like we don't ever have a dud like you can call I think it could be trained I I counsel youtubers all the time and show them how to go from getting a couple million views a month to 10 millions views a month very easily and from even certain ones like Just one of my friends like he was just really struggling and so I just started showing him basically everything I know and just doing like once every week Sometimes once every two weeks calls and he went from ten thousand dollars a month on YouTube to over four hundred thousand just doing these little little counseling calls. And so, I mean, people can make excuses all they want and say it's just luck or say, you know, um, well, anyways, I don't even want to quote all the other stuff, but it's just, it is, it is a teachable skill. It's a learnable skill. You can study your way to consistently make viral videos, no matter how small your channel is, even if you have zero subscribers, you could, if you actually studied hard enough and like, basically, if you knew what I knew and some of these so I don't sound so arrogant also like some of these other friends I have that I'd say are the smartest people in the world when it comes to content creation online if you had the knowledge that was in our heads you could do it very easily I see people do it all the time and what's even more interesting is I go on podcasts and I say everything I know and these people are also very open some of them I know it's all out there and a lot of people instead of just studying that and trying to absorb and apply it in their own way, they're just like, no, it's just luck. So you do lay it all out there, but I got to push back to one interesting thing. I think a crucial component of your success is the idea stage, the idea generation, the brainstorm I heard today, but getting really good at generating ideas. So it's not just the selection of the thumbnail and the title, that creative process. It's also just the engine of generating really good ideas and getting that. I would say that is probably the thing that needs to be trained the most for most creators, right? That they just don't put enough ideas on paper. Yes, but also a lot of creators also just don't, you know, which I didn't either for the longest time, just didn't don't make good enough content. You know content that's worthy of getting 10 million views in the idea or the execution of the idea both I mean like think about how many people just make videos they film them under 20 minutes and they don't really put any effort into it and like you know It's like my first 500 videos didn't deserve to get a million views like there's a reason they did they're terrible You know, but at the time I thought they did right now I'm in the mindset of a lot of small youtubers or I thought those videos deserved a million views I thought the algorithm hated me but I'm watching back now and I can tell you exactly why the videos are just fucking horrible You know what I mean? Well, so what was the breakthrough for you to start realizing is to start having a self-awareness, you know about These videos are good enough. You're probably still going through that. You're probably still growing to see like yeah every six months you should look back and hate your videos or at least see things you could improve and be like oh I could have done this better that better if not then you you're not learning quick enough. In my opinion, at least. Where's the source of that learning even for you now? Just look at the metrics. I just got back from a mastermind where I just got like 10 of the smartest people I knew and we just locked ourselves in a cabin and taught each other stuff. Constantly every day, not every day now, probably every other day, I go on a walk and I just call random people. I'll just say, teach me something. And I mean, it's just You just have to have a never ending thirst for learning link that's very imperative especially if you want like if you want to get on top and then stay on top the only way to do it is just to constantly be learning or someone who is learning is just gonna be out have a leg up on you the knowledge game. And what kind of stuff are you because you talked about offline that you just love learning of all kinds doesn't matter but in terms of videos you study videos are you studying. Recently not as much. I'm more because to get to the videos I want I have to build this business and scale up and hire some more my recent time has been like my teenage years were spent studying virality and studying content creation now I'm studying how to build a content company so I can actually produce the crazy ideas I want to produce if that makes any sense. So yeah and that's the business side we talked about hiring do you have trouble firing people. No I'm pretty sure I'm a every person, yeah, actually every person I've ever fired, we just give them severance. And I like to see it more as it's no ill will, like if there's like if I fired you, if there's some other job you want me to help you get, I'll DM them on Twitter. Like, you know, if you want to go work for, I don't know, insert whatever MTV, give me someone to DM. I'll DM them. Like, you know, I try to make it more like a transition and do whatever we can to make it as easy as possible. something was just not working for you because you want people like you said super passionate because at the end of the day if you hold someone that you onto someone that you don't see being here in 10 years you're just doing with a disservice you're just giving them more ingrained more enrooted and where they are and the sooner you do it and help them move on to the like new life the better. Given all the wisdom you have now if you were to give advice to somebody or if you were to start over again. You had no money. Won't be the first 10 videos you tried to make on a new channel. I guess that's advice for a new person and nobody knows you. Yeah, nobody knows me. Yeah, I have a mask on. And you also, I guess, don't have the wisdom. But if I don't have what I have in my head, then I would say just fail. Like just a lot of people get analysis paralysis and they'll just sit there and they'll plan their first video for three months and yeah, I'm any of you listening if you especially if you have zero views on your channel your first video is not going to give you. Period. It's not your first 10 are not going to give you. I can very comfortably say that. So stop sitting there and thinking for months and months on in and just get to work and start uploading. Like all you need to do this applies to people that have not uploaded videos but have dreams of being a YouTuber is make 100 videos and improve something every time. Do that. And then on your 101st video, we'll start talking like maybe you can get some views, but you know, your first hundred are gonna start. There are very freak cases like Lysocotia or Emma Chamberlain who have really good personalities and it doesn't take them so as many videos. And it's just like people who are seven foot five and making the NBA like, yes, there are free cases you can find. But for the average person like us, you know, who don't have these exceptional personalities and backgrounds in filmmaking, just make 100 videos, improve something each time, and then talk to me on your 101st video. Well, the improve something each time is a tricky one. How do you improve something each time? The second one, just put more effort into the script. The third one, try to learn a new editing trick. The fourth one, try to figure out a way that you can have better inflections in your voice. The fifth one, try to study a new thumbnail tip and implement at the sixth one, try to figure out a new title. There's infinite ways. That's the beauty of content creation online. There's literally infinite ways from the coloring to the frame rate to the editing to the filming to the production to the jokes to the pacing to every little thing can be improved and they can never not be improved. There's literally no such thing as a perfect video. So if you knew everything you know now, but no money. Step one, would I just brainstorm like, okay, I don't have money, what are some viral things like I mean the first thing that comes to mind is something as simple as when I count to a hundred thousand which is what I did do when I was poor and like that work but like what's something like that I could do that would be even more attention. Yeah you were as part of the brainstorm you would throw out a lot of ideas and people throw out a bunch of ideas and one of the questions is this even doable right yeah first off come up with that You think would do well and then ask yourself later if they're doable. Yeah, cuz there's there's different ways you can accomplish something Don't be cynical about the do ability of stuff. Yeah, because there really are so many different ways you can accomplish a goal like When we give away an island like we give our hundred million subscriber an island Yeah, you know, you can't find private islands that you know don't look like shit for less than ten million dollars So this isn't doable right all right The idea doesn't exist, not doable, exit off. But then you dig into it and you find different alternatives and you find, okay, what if we just buy a $2 million island that sucks and then spend $1 million importing some sand, let's build a beach, let's import 300 trees, let's build a little bit of canal, let's cut some paths. Boom. Now it's a really nice island, but it's actually affordable because we don't have $10 million spent on a video, but we can't Then afford to spend three and a half and lose whatever a million dollars on that video. So like that's an example of like, yeah, if you just went off the gut test, you're like, this isn't doable. You know, every island is $10 million or we're screwed. Like if we go cheaper, it's just a terrible island. No. And so if you like, there are so many different ways you can achieve what you want, you really got to push through notes, which not a lot of people do. You have to have like a more of a dominant personality and just a willingness to When people tell you it's not possible just actually go through all the variables and eliminate them all yourself Have a stubbornness and a resilience to failure maybe for what we do and creators online. It's very imperative that you have That a no isn't a no do you like you really have to like think and and just like we take a personality test and like just having a dominant personality Personality is a better indicator that when someone tells you oh, there's no way you're gonna build a brick wall for under a hundred grand You know you'll be like okay, and then still go check the next ten vendors. Yeah, you know figure it out Yeah, what advice would you give to an already established channel like with one two three four million subscribers? How to like ten exit like increase it um without losing maybe yeah, that's where it's very specific Like channel by channel you can't give general advice. Okay. Yeah, because if I do Millions of creators are gonna see this and then they're gonna do it and I'm gonna fuck them over You know, I say see so let's say I'd like two million subscribers on this podcast Yeah, like how would you 10x that without sacrificing what it is 10x your stuff doesn't matter so we you've talked about what success Yeah, it's different for everyone like it's 10xing your definition of success. No. Well then, it's gonna be right off the bat. It's hard because if you don't give a shit about 10xing, it's even harder to 10x. He does this because he likes helping people. That's one thing I found throughout this day. Every time I talk data, it's so funny with him because it's like, you know, you could do this to get more views and he'll just be like blank. Like that doesn't register anything. He just like doesn't care, which is it's really, I'm really nervous about that. I'm really nervous about the numbers affecting Cuz it's so fun. Oh, yeah, it's so fun to focus on the numbers and I'm really worried about that but at the same time you should be Cognizant of that because you've created not just some of the most watched videos But some of the most amazing videos ever so it's there's a strong correlation there. It's not like you're selling your soul to make a highly viewed video It's actually if you look at the metrics it helps you understand what is compelling and not and so I feel like I am I Feel like there's some value to investigate What work when people tune on and when not to be date more data driven even on podcasts But I'm really afraid on the flip side I think part of the appeal is that you don't care about that kind of stuff But there there could be stuff that doesn't have to do anything with that and has to do with stylistic choices of lighting and cameras or maybe with, for example, topics. Even what you've asked me here is different than what most people ask me. Yeah, so it could be nice to understand that, but again, I'm worried about polluting the creative process. At the end of the day, this is a true case of it's your own intuition. You know your viewers better than anyone else. It's whatever see I'd like to push back on that. I really don't you do I don't name one person who knows your viewers better than you Somebody that looks at numbers of podcast. No, you know your viewers, you know, you're the only how many episodes have you done? 350 exactly, but I'm not paying it. No, you're the only one who's watched every second of all 350 of them probably that's just that's just not know what I haven't but the Well cuz you did it so you do know know what's in it all. It's your content. I'm telling you, you do. And this is just one of those moments where you're an intelligent guy and you just have to trust your instincts. Just think, what is the typical ex-viewer and what do they want? I don't think like that. But that's all you would have to do. And whatever your gut tells you, that would be the best guess. You don't know what the typical viewer is though. I don't because to investigate that would be very very difficult and then you have to start looking at the numbers you have to start to like consider demographics the only way I know that anybody even watches it is because I'll sometimes run into people like when I run along the river and they'd be like I love you likes it's like okay well that that's that's a data point and they're like cool people but you know I don't know any like I don't have any other it's difficult man it's difficult to know It's difficult to know who listens to boxes the difficulty. Do you have a sense of who's I mean like you're so huge that everybody watches? Yeah, but no, I still do I'd say if you were to just put a gun to my head and you're you're like, all right We're gonna pick a random person that watched your last video and you have to like roughly guess what they are And if you're not close we'll kill you I would say probably like a teenager that plays video games like some something like that would be probably the typical one. And then there are people that are maybe a little bit younger. A lot of people are older as well. But in a random sample size, yeah, it's probably like a male boy that plays video games. Like that's the best way I've described it. But I don't try to pertain to them. I just make whatever I think is interesting and good content. And this is what we were talking about before, even though hypothetically 35 to 40% of my audience is women, which is, you know, less than a majority, if we get 100 million views of video, that's still 30 to 40 million females that watch every video, which is probably the largest views per video for women on the whole platform, which you wouldn't think that. I can't think of a single other creator that gets more women to watch their videos than that. And so it's just anything, even people above the age of 30, even if it's only like three or 4%, That's still 3 to 4% of 100 million views is a lot of people that age. So we hit a large group of kind of every demographic. If that makes any sense. So what if we look at other maybe more challenging kinds of channels or not? But if we look at educational, for example, like lectures, or if we look, yeah, educational, it could be short videos, like how would you tax that? like something on robotics and biology on science and engineering and all that. That's more educational focused. We would honestly just have to pull the, because it's the same way if you went to Gordon Ramsay, you said, how would a new cook cook better? You know, it's like, even then that's not even specific. You have to go channel by channel. You really do or I'm giving horrible advice because if there was these just go rules, everyone do it. You know what I mean? Like, there's these magical little principles. How quickly when you look at a channel, can you kind of give advice? Yeah, it's like surface love at the start. And then the more if we watch 10 videos, I feel like I'd have a good profile. And I could tell you, in my opinion, you know, especially once I look at the analytics and I get more ingrained in like, okay, the typical viewers list, they're from here, here's how they're feeling, you know, because there are people who make videos for Rednecks. And like the Rednecks taste of content is so much different than obviously women watching makeup videos, which are so much different than teenage boys watching a Minecraft video. They're just all different. So the biggest thing you have to do is put your head in the head space of the viewer and see the content how they would. Because if you just try to only give your taste, which is what a lot of people do, and things from your perspective, it's very biased and it's just not going to work for everyone. And that's actually how you do more harm than good, which is something I'm very careful of. Yeah, but at the same time, just generating a lot of ideas. I think the first time I've talked to you was on Clubhouse, actually. Yeah. I mentioned something about robots and like almost immediately you went to generating a bunch of ideas around. Oh yeah, easily. It's just 100 robots versus 100 humans. Yeah. Yeah. I'll park in a robot throw a potato. I think your idea like the first idea was because you just said so many ideas I never even thought of, but it's It shows the value of basically brainstorming with people that think differently. At the end of the day, my ideas are probably, you know, might lean towards some people a little bit younger than your audience. Like some of the stuff. There's still ideas. Like I think the first one you said, because we're talking about quadruped, like robot dogs, you said to replace a biological dog with a robot dog and see if the owner notices something. You were just quickly brainstorming. storming different ideas of like how does it years ago I remember it. Yeah. Which is just, I mean, it's like, oh yeah, I never really thought about that kind of sort of it's the basic the tension between what does it take for robot and AI system to replace the biological systems that we the biological creatures that we love in our lives. Yeah. And but like that was like the the pace of idea generation. Was the thing that struck me today and in general is like that's how you get at good videos as you keep keep it makes it's much easier to Make a video around a good idea obviously than a bad one and get you just send yourself up for success Okay, so that's for 10x seniority popular channel. What's the hardest number you said the the numbers that matters click-through rate average average view duration and surveys. What's the hardest number to optimize for? Probably surveys. Do you have any insight into the surveys at all? No, not really. But if you just click on a bunch of random videos online, you'll eventually get a survey. What's this video transformative, heartwarming, inspiring? What people rate does make a difference? You can give people a click of video, you can get them to watch it, but you can't really fake whether or not they're satisfied. They don't lie, the surveys. Maybe one person here, they're my troll, but once you aggregate enough, it's a pretty clear telltale of the video. So either you're making a great video or you're not. What is it? Minimizing the non-regrettability. Yeah, I think Elon tweeted that. That's what he's trying to do on Twitter. Twitter and that's interesting. That's basically the survey metric how happy you are that you've been using the platform. Yeah, you know I tweeted we want to limit the amount of regrettable minutes people spit on Twitter and the first thing I thought it's like that's something YouTube already has a lot like their whole survey system when feedback loop. How tough is it to take on YouTube you think? Like for Twitter? Yeah for Twitter for anybody else. I mean it's gonna be basically impossible. I mean YouTube's not going anywhere And I don't know I don't I don't think it was gonna do what YouTube does better than them at least not in the next 10 years You asked on Twitter would you rather have $10 million or 10 million subscribers on YouTube? What would your own answer be at various stages in your career if I if I had nothing I would say $10 million so you can With ten million dollars you can hire some people on pump out content with like a million or two get ten million subscribers and then keep the other eight million So that's if you believe in your ability to grow a channel if you well if you yeah If you don't believe in your ability to grow a channel then you shouldn't take the ten million subscribers because you're just gonna kill the chance So the ten million is definitely a better question be would you rather have a million dollars? So 10 million subscribers that's where it gets a little tricky because now it's like hmm, you know a million dollars life-changing amount of money But you know if you semi-know what you're doing you probably make a million dollars off a 10 million subscriber channel But a million dollars might not be enough to build a strong team because you don't know how to do it So you might waste all of that money. Yeah, or they just keep it and retire. Yeah, okay. That's true. Yeah, cuz 10 million is just so high. It's like Just never work again who cares for the average human that's so much money It's interesting to me also to the value of the subscriber versus the value of the dollar I suppose how valuable is the subscriber for? Like what percentage of the videos like how active the subscribers and watching the video um For you that's hard. I don't know I was actually thinking more about the subscriber to dollar like if someone has 10 million subscribers have that made 10 million dollars. I don't know why that kind of popped in my head. It's an interesting thought. Do you ever, when you analyze videos, do you ever analyze videos like we've talked about offline of other videos across the YouTube in general to understand trends, to understand social behind all that? Not all, but a lot of the questions are analytic space. Yeah, it's so fun. I love it. I mean, it's just a giant social experiment, right? Like what people like to watch, what people share. It's like a fascinating look. So, like I said before, what percentage of your audience do you think care about this kind of stuff? Like this deeply about YouTube analytics? I think a large amount care about curiosity and exploration of interesting ideas. So in that sense, Yeah, this was this was fitted. I love it. This is funny. And this isn't me like trying to make I love you actually Magnus one and even your Hikaru one was really good a bunch of other ones, but I think we're getting to the point now where only analytics junkies would want to keep hearing more analytics talk and the normie is probably like they've had their dose of YouTube talk for the next three years Maybe I'm wrong. Hey comment if I'm wrong. I could be. I don't know your audience. See, this is where you would tell me, shut up. I know my audience. You dumbass. And I don't at all. I actually, I just follow the thread of curiosity. And I think there's just a lot of curious humans in the world. And to me, it's like, so the question about analytics is the question of basically stepping away, stepping outside of yourself and thinking why the hell do I like TikTok so much? Why do I like Twitter so much? Why do I like YouTube so much? And getting, even if you're not a creator, getting an insight into that is really interesting. It's like what, because all these platforms are fundamentally changing the nature of content. People are reading books less, they're probably going to be watching movies less and less, they're probably going to be watching Netflix looks less and less. Do you ever think about the sort of the darker side of YouTube and with shadow banning and censorship and all the kind of topics, especially if you see it on other platforms like Twitter that Elon recently highlighted the shadow banning that was happening and in general the censorship that was happening on those platforms. Do you think about the role of centralized control of which information isn't or isn't made available through search and discovery. I'll be honest. I never really think about it. You just try to make fun videos that... Yeah, I'm kind of more in my own lane, but it's not like that I don't just specifically think about that. I just like a lot of stuff in general. I'm just kind of in my own lane thinking about my own stuff. But you know, now that you're asked, curious, what are your thoughts on YouTube and that kind of stuff? Well, I'm generally against centralized censorship or shadow banning. Shadow banning is the worst one because not that the goal of creating a healthy platform where you're having great conversations and videos that are not spreading misinformation, that sounds like an admirable goal, but that's too difficult of a job for a centralized entity. That's too big of an it. Yeah, there's the misinformation stuff and then there's also just like the videos where they do something that causes what happened back there the were Atpocalypse, you know and a lot of creators revenue plummets because people are doing videos that advertisers don't deem acceptable and then now all these big advertisers are pulling and The little guys are getting hit and because ad raise dropped by 30% and the first who just quit his job to go full-time, consecration now can't sustain it. So it's also, it's like a lot of different variables as well. That makes it so complicated. Well, I think the big thing is transparency, especially around shadow banning for people. I agree. On shadow banning, you should be transparent. You should let people know. It, you know, obviously there has to be some type of controls. People can't just post whatever. And so if you're pulling those levers, they should at least now. Yeah, so they know how to improve their content, they can understand it, they can... Exactly. If it's a wrong shadow banning, like as a society that we should not shadow ban this kind of content, that means you should be publicly discussing it and having that... Because if it's not known, then it's just kind of like, well, then who's pulling the strings and like, how do we know they're not just manipulating things to get whatever message they want out there? there and silence other ones. Yeah, there could be sort of in the background government influence, which is where actual freedom of speech comes into play that government should not have any control or be able to put pressure on censorship of speech. And it gets weird if none of that is being there's no transparency around it. But to be fair, that's a huge responsibility. The amount of content that you YouTube is a upload on YouTube that is shared by YouTube, viewed by you. But even more of a reason why it would probably make sense to be transparent. Yeah. Because then people can help fact check it. That's right. But that requires building a platform that makes that easy, right? Like, to make fact checking easy, to make the like Twitter now has like being able to share context and all that kind of stuff that crowd-sourcer, crowd-sourcer the way Wikipedia crowdsourced it. I mean, there's, it's right. And then you open a random Wikipedia article. But like, you know, people criticize Wikipedia because there is a political lean to the editors of Wikipedia, and then they get the some articles that definitely have a bias to them and all that kind of stuff. It's a difficult problem. It's a difficult problem to solve that ultimately has much as possible it would be nice for the viewer to have control of that versus the the entity that's hosting it so for the viewer to decide that stuff I'm just gonna make cool videos that yeah yeah let's go to Antarctica again how was that how's going do you just came back from Antarctica that was I watched the video that was that was fun that was a really fun video thank you there's I mean there's a lot of things I can comment about that. But what was the hardest part of making that video? The hardest part was just getting out there. It's just so remote. And you land the plane on just this ice runway and it's so sketchy. And then once the plane takes off, you're just there. You're the most remote place on the planet. And it's just very breathtaking. If you have the chance to ever go to Antarctica, I would recommend it. It was probably like the, in the video, we climbed a mountain that wasn't named so we can name it. And like standing on top of that mountain and just seeing kind of like nothing. And because once you get outside the outskirts and you get deep in Antarctica, there's no penguins and nothing lives there at all. And so there's just nothing in every direction. It's just snow and these crazy beautiful mountains and some of them stick into the clouds and if you go during summertime, the sun never goes down. So the sun's up 24-7 and it's just like spinning in circles at the top of the planet or whatever. It looks like the top. Yeah, you guys come with this several times, it's called beautiful. Yeah, and so it's just, yeah, it's just very beautiful. What about shooting itself like the technical aspects of shooting it? Oh, I mean, well, so somehow we lucked out one of the days was like the warmest day and like forever that's been in Antarctica. It's like it's positive degrees, but at certain parts it's also like negative 20, negative 30. And that's where the cameras you constantly have to be switching out the batteries and heating them up and like putting them basically in like your pants or they'll just get way too cold. And we were prepared for much worse, but it ended up being much better than we thought. So for that video, but in general, maybe some other challenging videos, how does how do you go from the idea stage to the actual execution to the final video. Can you take me through like a full process of like we're talking about some crazy wild ideas today. How do you go from that to a final video where you click publish? Well, I mean, obviously first things first, you gotta figure out the idea and then it just depends. I mean, pick any video you can think of on my channel. I can take you through it. Well, what about the In a circle you have to stay in a circle for 100 days. Yeah, so for that one step one one of the most popular. Yeah, that video did really well. Yeah, so we Promise we have to this is where you get really into the nuances of the company because we have a lot of videos going out You can't just in a vacuum be like all right. We're not doing anything for 100 days. We're only filming this so step one is we had to build an independent that can actually do that for 100 days. That way everyone else could keep working on the normal videos and not just screw everything up. So step one, you build that team. Okay, we got the team. Now what do we need? Well, to do this, we need probably like 10 cameras, at least rolling at all times. So we're probably going to need to get a trailer and hook up a bunch of storage and stuff to just carry out the sheer volume of footage we're going to have. get a trailer set up the cameras go on the field paint a circle now we need a house go buy a house bring it out there and then it's like oh wait i think it'd be funny if i brought the house in on the intro yeah you know find a crane that can lift up a house so i can drive it in and drive it in the intro and that's like an iterative process where you're like okay this would be funnier so this is not all up front these right yeah ideally it would be but as you kind of see things you get inspired and then you think about more and more and this would be better with a crane yeah it'd be better if I dropped out of the house yeah that was crazy that you decided to do that so fearless in the kind of crazy stuff you willing to do exactly what I'm a broken record but whatever makes the best video possible yeah that's that's all you you focus on okay so what about the delegation of like who gets to what are the cameraman like the people people operating the cameras, who's responsible for different things. Is it like a distributed process? Well, that's where whoever the lead cam would be on that video would just decide it. That one, because we shot over a hundred days, we didn't, a lot of it was just Sean and the guy who was in the circle just vlogging. I just gave him a camera and he figured it out. And then we'd have like for him just set hours each day that a cameraman would come. So if he had any content, he needed extra hands instead of just having someone on standby 24-7. It made more sense to do set hours. Nice. And it was hard, but it's funny in hindsight. It sounds so simple. And I guess the more, because that one is relatively simple, I guess, because it's a low number of people. Yeah, the hard part about that is just the time. I checked in on them so many different days. And it's like an hour here, two hours there, three hours there over a hundred days adds up to be a ton of time and even then like you know if you have a 10 person crew you know paying them daily rates for a hundred days it just all that adds up. What about like the hundred versus hundred, hundred adults versus hundred kids? What was the what was bringing that to life that seems like exceptionally challenging. Yeah basically the thought process was we did a hundred kids Versus our hundred boys versus hundred girls. Yeah, people loved it. Honestly. I didn't think they'd like it as much as they did video did really really well. So the second I saw that video was crushing. I was like, all right, we're doing it again. But last time we did it, we did in our studio. So we built a giant room, put a hundred girls in it. Sounds bad when I explain it like this. And then a giant room put a hundred boys. Yeah. And we're like, after a hundred hours, whichever room has the most people will give them half a million dollars. So did well. So like, all right, we're going to do it again. So we threw out all these different ideas. It was like 100 football players versus 100 cheerleaders, 100 this, 100 that, 100 prisoners versus 100 cops. It's just craziest ideas. And we settled on 100 kids versus 100 adults. And then the next step was like, how do we make it better? The kids versus adults are the boys versus girls. The first one we did was inside. And the problem was every time it was night when we did these long time lapses, couldn't see the sun go up and down. So we're like, okay, this time I want to do it outside. So the cubes are outside. And instead of doing circles, we want to make them cubes. And then, you know, figure out do we want that. Yeah, just those videos came up with these today as ones that are like really complicated in terms of the audio in terms of how it's filming. Yeah, that's the problem. We had a lot of audio issues because in the first one, we didn't have a roof on it. The second one, there was a roof. So there's a lot of reverb, which then in editing made it brutal. Like half the shots weren't usable and it really screwed us over. So we had to do a lot of Frankensteining in the editing to make up for basically my ignorance. So you mentioned that you were surprised how well that that that one did. A lot of creators talk about getting depressed when the videos don't do as well as they kind of expected. There's a kind of feeling You can get really worn out by that dude. Yeah Do you yourself feel that and also do you have advice for others that feel this? Um, yeah, it's weird because I am a numbers guy, but also it used to It used to very much especially when I was like betting everything I had on a video when it did bad I was devastated man. I'd cry and I'd be depressed for days and It really would have a severe impact on my mood, but I don't know now. It doesn't really matter It's a if a video does that I just look at it. I'm like, oh why this video do that? Probably oh, there's a little retention dip there. I don't think people like the thumbnail Maybe we should switch it I just look at it objectively unemotional and then just move on and I feel like that's a much healthier way of going about it So if a creator is listening like that is the ideal way to respond to a video that's doing bad just remove emotion from the equation and just look at it and figure out how you can. Is there tricks to detect being able to detach yourself from the from that because because like in your case I mean that's true for creators but in your case. There's like a lot of money on the line yeah what this video is cost my life yeah so much time but now I mean you just I mean. I don't know the only real answer is just a conscious effort You just have to unemotionally look at the video determine the problems and then move on like there's there is no secret You know what I mean? It's just that's it's that and if you really can't bring yourself to do it Then you're just screwed. Honestly, maybe you're not mid for this game Okay, so that's part of the development as a creator is like you're being able to be longevity. Yeah Yeah, you have to unemotionally be able to look at videos that flop and figure figured out. Because if not just getting, you can't, and not every video can be a one out of 10. And so when a video does bad, you know, that, that just stress and depression is just going to eventually get to you in the long run. So you said you've failed in a bunch of videos, sort of taking them to completion. So what are some of the biggest fails? Yeah, weirdly enough, as we've matured and we've done this more, we don't have that problem as much, especially we're getting some multi-million dollar budgets per video. It's like failure is not really an option anymore. So I'm a little more particular about what I do, but back in the day, yeah, like we would do a video where we spent 24 hours on a deserted island and we filmed it, did it all and I just, I didn't like it after the edit. So I just grabbed the boys and we went back to the deserted island and spent another 24 hours there and refilmed it. Or Could that have been caught and prevented at the idea stage like where no, it's a good idea It was just poor execution to be honest when we were out there was hot We were we're just like we all at one point just kind of wanted to die. It was just miserable So how do you how do you avoid that these days? Well, I just want what is a little cooler to be honest? Literally the amount of fun we had the video was like 10 times higher. Oh interesting. So you like there's some practical details here you just learned. Yeah, I don't... Videos that where it's very hot or it's on water because I get super seasick, there's like a kind of like 10 things that if they have these variables, I'm down to do it. But my fun meter is not as high as normal. Like we tried to spend... Anytime we do anything on a boat, like when we spent 24 hours in a beer maker triangle or when I tried to to spend like, which it didn't get upload, but try to spend like a hundred hours at sea or whatever, just like on a raft. It just like, it makes me want to throw up and I get so seasick. I came in sea straight, but there are just some videos that require me to be on a boat. So I just suck it up. So when you spend months in creating a video, I know this is probably stressful to some creators. Like how much stress, how do you feel when you have to click publish? Ah video no not much you able to detach yourself. Yeah, I Again and old me tons I'm right be like scratching and nervous and like my hands will be sweating like the point where I'm almost about to puke I'm like I really hope people like this, but you know, I don't know I think that's just part of maturing it. There's different as a country is different phases and You just like once you get over the the fear that you're just going to wake up one day and be irrelevant. And you just accept that. You believe in yourself and you believe in your content and that you can continue to be relevant. Then you don't, I don't know, it's a little bit easier to attach yourself, I guess. And it's a much healthier place to be. You can't do this for 10 years if every little thing just causes these huge emotional reactions. It's like, that's why a lot of creators Go a little you know mentally insane. You know you have to get out of that game because it really messes with you We've talked about this a little bit, but how do you define and how do you suggest others define success? I need to subjective some some people success is retiring their mom Literally, you know for you find sess is inspiring people and educating them and you know, whatever the peak in their kerosene Yeah, um for other people it's just quitting their job. So you have to self-reflect on what your definition of success is because I think a lot of creators kind of don't really think don't introspect Like they kind of want to keep getting more and more subscribers kind of thing. Yeah, but subscribers is just a vanity metric, you know, it doesn't subscribers don't correlate to views Sure or views what yeah, I know but that's more that was a direct to you that's more directed people listening because a lot of people do really care about subscribers or even followers like on tiktok but if you look like Your view on youtube very very few percent if even a percent of your views come from the sub feed right? They're almost all home for your suggestion. What's the last time you clicked on your sub feed to watch a video? Oh almost never yeah, maybe five years ago It used to be a thing. It's not anymore. No one does and it's getting harder and harder to find. Subscribe to way too many channels, I think. Yeah, that's what everyone does and you subscribe to 10 channels. They're great, but two years later your taste evolves and it's like it's a mess. And so, subscribers don't really matter. Followers on TikTok don't really matter. So, anyways, they really are the definition of a vanity metric. But what about views they do obviously because the people are showing up time and time again. That's what matters. Okay, so that That's a good thing to define a success. I just feel like that too can be a problem because I Would say you know if I wanted to be successful like a young creator I might start copying mr. Beast or something like that, right? Like there's you start trying to take shortcuts as opposed to find your your own unique voice Right. So like chasing views a problem too. It feels like or no It's as long as you detach yourself from the I mean if you're the Sounds like you're lazy. Yeah, and you just want to copy someone else to not experiment and find your own way But yeah, I mean you can't make that excuse for them and some No one just isn't coming up with the original stuff and putting in the effort. You can't just say, oh, it's because they're chasing views. We need some different metric for them to chase. No, they just need to find their own way. It just feels like unique type of content will often lead to sacrifice in the number of views in the short term. By the long term, you win. Okay. Or if you do win, you win more, I guess would be a better way of putting it. Do you think you will IPO miss mr. Beasburger or feastables in the next five ten years? Beasburger or feastables. No, I kind of think There's something you know what I just realized this is our first time talking about those We're like an hour and a half and that's so funny. We started talking about what? My retention brain kicked in I wonder if you have retention brain for for life itself. I do. Every time I'm talking to someone, I'm like, okay. What about loved ones? Spending time with loved ones thinking we could be doing something much better right now. Yes. No, that is a serious problem. We'll pause the V-Sphere question. Yes. But that's why my current girlfriend, which I was telling you before when we were talking about this, she has a genuine love for learning. And that's something I have. I always feel like I need to be learning something to justify the time I'm spending. And so that's why it's such a nice trait because I feel like that time is being used optimally because whether we're watching a documentary or we're going and taking IQ tests or reading about whatever, just why modern art is a thing. I don't know. Whatever weird thing we decide to do. I'm always learning and improving. So it justifies the time. So to maximize retention in your relationship, you want to spend time at that time learning as much as possible. Yeah, which conveniently I don't have to force, right? Or I want to be recharging. So when I do work, I can hit the ground harder. And luckily, we're into a lot of the same things, which happen to be learning. Sometimes it's not learning, like maybe watching an anime or something like that. But I'm a big believer and you're either if you will if you if your goals to be like a super successful entrepreneur you either be working or you need to be doing something that decompresses and recharges you so you can work again if your goals to be like a really kick-ass up to mirror and obviously we're pulling this down to like a very basic thing and so the the things you're doing your doubt time when you're not working if it doesn't recharge you you're screwed You're just a ticking time bomb waiting to upload and so you got to like heavily recharge and like so like watching for me and anime or whatever it is playing a board game like that is actually kind of crucial to my success which takes a lot of maturing to come to that conclusion because I used to be the kind of guy that wanted to work every hour of the day and I would try to train myself to not need need that stuff. And I almost resented like that. I have to do these kinds of things and it would piss me off because it's not optimal. And I just really want to make content and entertain people. But as someone who's gone down that road, then you just work every day for two, three months straight and every hour of the day, and then you just a bomb way to explode and lose your mind. And the only real sustainable thing is to just like give yourself time to recharge in between working. So there's a kind of balance you have to find. You have to. I hate it more than anyone else. You hate not working. Yeah, because it's just not optimal for time. As a human, I do need to occasionally watch a mindless show and play a board game. And it took me a very long time to come to peace with that and not I would have like borderline panic attacks when I do it because I just what am I doing right now? Why am I doing this? I should be you know like what if one day I have to lay off an employee because we're not doing so well like how could I justify watching this this show or whatever I'm doing right now you know it's like there's a lot of things like that that go on in your head but it's necessary. Before we return to Mr. Beastburger What is like a since run the topic what is a perfect day in the life perfectly productive day in life a mr. Beast look like oh boy Well, I mean like a stand I mean the perfectly productive day is we film a main channel video like because those get 100 million a pop I mean it doesn't really get any better than that What about like the average day when you're not on the set? Yeah, you're like pull it Like because you're running a lot of things right? Yeah So right now we have our snack brand feastables We have a restaurant chain peace burger and then we basically Which we haven't even really launched a product yet But we have the the data company that I was showing you where we're gonna roll out some tools for creators And then we have the reaction channel the gaming channel the main channel and then we have my charity which also has a channel And so kind of how I've structured my life Right now is whatever I have free time. We just kind of go hey guys Jimmy's got an hour from 2 p.m. To 3 p.m. And it's everyone's just like I need this I need this and this sounds like I need this thing filmed or you know, whatever the guy who runs my tics I'm sick I need this tiktok filmed or You know Beastburgers like I need this menu item approved Do we need to talk about this marketing thing and then we kind of just look at what everyone needs and we're like that one looks like the most important, we'll do that. And then, so it's just kind of like, you know, if I just did that for every company in a day, then that's optimal. If I just kind of like an optimal day for me would be going down to eight companies and just whatever their like two to three biggest pain points or things to need from me and just doing those. Based on priority and then trying to keep it as short as possible. Yeah. To just the things that you're needed on. It doesn't get more optimal than that. If I clear the bottlenecks or some bottlenecks for all my companies and it's yes that's a perfect day yeah I mean even just me because you're like you're showing me around and you're being a great and gracious host but on top of that you're just doing all these meetings you you basically I felt bad at some points I was like oh I just tricked him into going to meetings with me he's like my little meeting buddy yeah I mean it was fun it was fun to see it it was fun to see how and effectively you've delegated you basically trust the team to do a really good job on the various things and there's just a strong team that's able to Carry the flag on all the different tasks from the from the brainstorming in the main channel to the reacts and so on Yeah, it's really interesting I mean it's really interesting what it takes to build a team like that because you very quickly build a very large team that's that's able to scale which is very scary because it's my first, you know, I'm 24, you know, and I think I was telling you this earlier. It's funny because six years ago I had to raise my hand to use the bathroom and now I'm in charge of hundreds of people and entertain hundreds of millions of people. And so it is crazy just how quick it comes up. And I wish I was a little bit older so I could have ran a couple of companies and failed a few companies in the past and like learn from those and apply those here because I know for a fact when I'm 34 I'm 24 now when I'm 34. I'll know so much more about running a business and scaling and hiring and and how to lead people and better effectively communicate all these different skill sets that will make me a better leader that uh that's the only thing that sucks is uh I just don't have those because I just haven't been through the lessons and I just have such a lucrative thing on my plate right now and it just I have to learn the lessons with the lucrative thing, you know what I mean? Yeah, because you already have so much influence, so much impact, but you have effectively scaled. What lessons do you draw from that, how to effectively scale as a 24 year old? Yeah, that's something I feel like I actually could give a lot of value to, to young people who are doing it. Like older people who've built five companies or whatever they do. I probably couldn't, you know, they're going to be like, Oh, this is so obvious. But for younger first-time business owners, you got to just experiment to be honest. And for us, like it's just a new space. No one had really ever skilled up a hundred person team to build, make content on YouTube. So there wasn't no, I spent all this time, like I hired one person from Disney at one point to come in and help. And obviously, I was a dumb idea looking back on it, but you know, I thought, oh, they make great stuff. People want to watch and they come over here and help me build a team. And, you know, they build it more of the traditional way and not like how it should be online. And so then it's like, okay, now I'm not trying to trash people like they all tried their best, but then I hire this one person who does this different type of media and runs a hundred person team. And then you come in here and they try to build it. That way they don't really listen to your value or see the difference and I tried basically for building this company was like four or five different people who worked in different veins of media and You know every single time it just like they just don't get it and they like they don't understand my world and the the eventual solution was just like to roll up my sleeves and do it myself you know with like James or a hand man and just like No one's ever done this and like no one's gonna just give us a golden carrot and tell us how to build this company we gotta figure it the fuck out ourselves and you have to build up people from scratch then yeah exactly all this stuff i was talking about earlier and all the lessons i learned along the way. And so for me that was a big part of like it's try to stop trying to have someone. Build this company for me and just do it myself because it's scary like i spent my whole life studying youtube videos of virality not. business building. But fuck it. I was like, I guess we just got to do it ourselves. And that's where things really start to click. And we got the exponential growth. We started getting the right people and training them the right way. And, you know, just throwing conventional stuff out the door and focusing on what's actually practical for YouTube, which is just completely different than traditional media. So you train people and then those people train people and so on. Yeah, I mean, it's just even like, you know, how you do the lighting on sets or like how you do the audio or, or, um, you know, not writing scripts. So, you know, we're just not as efficient with our filming. Like sometimes I have to have 30 cameras running. Why? Because it's not scripted. I don't, I don't know what Chris is going to do when we started filming. He might run over there, but guess what? We got to have a plan because there's only one shot. I can't, you know, tell him not to do that. Yeah. That's the shooting. But then there's also the editing. Yeah, and then the editing as well and not having guardrails and kind of you know I The other day it's whatever I want the video that their job is to make a video that they think I'll like because it's my channel But you know you can achieve that kind of however and and so it's just everything's just different You know it's much more. I guess like a startup as opposed to Are you often surprised like with the result like? You think a certain like we watched the video today those really nice those different than you would have potentially edited yeah Are you sometimes surprised by like a decision that it or makes like okay? That's not the way I would have done it, but it's actually this is a cool idea. Yeah, of course Yeah, the thing my biggest fear is I don't ever want to get trapped in like a bubble of you know because we are getting a hundred million views of video on the main channel like I But I don't want to get in this feedback loop of just my ideas are great or I can not feedback loop but stop learning and improving because it is easy sometimes to be like what we're doing is working. We need to just keep doing it. I want to keep learning and trying new things. And I guess one way I'd put it is like, you don't when you're on a come up or you're growing, you don't want to test new things. once you start to plateau or have a downtrend because if you're like, you know, you you're skyrocketing, right? You're up up up and then you level off you start to go down and you're like, oh, this isn't working work. Let's start experimenting. Well, if you have a bad experiment, now you're in like a tailspin. You're nose diving and you have one more bad experiment. You're like, screwed kind of I'm oversimplifying. You want to test things while you're still growing to keep the growing from happening. Because once you have, again, very oversimplifying that level off, you do a couple of tests that go wrong. You're screwed. You're already out the door. Now you're just confirming that you're out the door and online entertainment. So that's kind of how I see it. So I think it's very imperative that you're constantly always experimenting and trying things, even if you're getting crazy, unheard of growth. And so that outside of the thing, That brought you to the dance you just dived right into Mr. Beast burger and feastables. There's a whole nother industry like what was that like what's up Beast burger we kind of It's supposed to be like just a pop-up like we just partnered with someone who had 300 restaurants and we're just like, you know Let's let's just sell Beast burgers for a day or two. Let's let's see what happens we didn't really think it would be as big as it was. But those first like that first day, you know, we do six figures in sales and they all sell out and they're running to local Walmart. They can't keep up with the demand. And it's like, okay, well, maybe let's just leave it open a week, whatever. And we're just doing crazy revenue. And it's like, okay, well, let's add some more restaurants and let's just leave them open for a month. And we're just still doing six figures a day. And kind of just went from this thing that was, I don't know, it wasn't really, I didn't really plan on running a restaurant chain, but here I am. But didn't that in some sense also open your mind to something like Feastable? Feastable is something I've always wanted to do because I think just in general, American snacks are just full of so much horrible ingredients to be honest, and they're not, I don't know, I feel like they're also just hasn't been any innovation in American snacks in quite a while. And so that's just something I've always been pretty passionate about. We built that from scratch. So we hired the CEO and built a team around them. And we spent probably over two and a half years before we even launched, just like building the right team, figuring things out and making sure it was actually ran the way I wanted, which FeeCyples has just been crushing. It's very interesting. This is something I've never talked about publicly, but having products in retail, it's like before Feastable's, everything I had done was online. So if you wanted to, you know, anything from the Quokua Peace brand, you'd have to buy it online and ship it to you. But Feastable's now that, you know, because our first product, Chocobars, we started putting that in retail locations. So like, for example, Walmart, it's It's crazy. It doesn't make sense how if you're, which I guess it does for, because we get a hundred million views of videos. So a lot of people know us. If I go stand on Walmart, those people recognize me and ask for photos. Like if I stood there long enough, I could take 150 photos today in Walmart or 200, whatever it is. So obviously it makes sense. Those people go for Feastables, but then you just multiply that by every Walmart in America. It just gets so crazy. And I didn't think we'd be doing the kind of revenue we are. And we're about to launch in some other, I don't know if I'm allowed to say it, so whatever, but other big retail locations and convenience stores. And by the end of next year, we could be in like 40, 50,000 locations. And the numbers just don't make sense. What are some interesting challenges about scaling there that surprised you? The biggest problem, which I didn't think would be was just keeping the shelves and Walmart stocked to be honest. So that supply chain. It was brutal. Well, even then sometimes you get them the stuff and it takes them a day or two to put it out in that specific location. And I had to stop promoting it because every time I'd mention it, 40% of people would just be like, it's not there. It's not in Walmart or I can't buy it. And so there's like a 3V Ish month period where I just didn't promote feastals because I was scared that someone would go by and this is not there and so like it took us a very long time to catch up to the demand and Also, you know, it's not we have unlimited money. So I but now we're relatively caught up in Keeping up, but it's gonna be interesting because now this year in 2023 we're gonna basically, you know 10x the amount of locations are in. And we're going to try to launch new products. We're in for an interesting ride. But yeah, I just hate when I tell people, you know, like, hey, go try this product. And then they go in their local Walmart and eventually other places that it's not there. It's just so brutal. They made that whole journey out there and they can get it. And so that was really it. Besides that, not It's been doing way better than I ever thought You've talked a couple places about maybe doing mobile games or computer games in the future. Yeah, is that something you're still considering? Yes, um, because Do you normally talk with people as much as we talked before him? No, no, no, that was all day every day Everything you asked me is stuff we already talked about. Not really. Well, no, no, not everything. I take it back. But sorry. The last two questions. Yes. And so it's just funny because... What? No, I try it so good. There's a different style of asking those questions because I on purpose didn't dig further. Would you... I could tell. Yeah. I could tell you... Okay. This is, by the way, okay. All right. Well, this is the first time I've ever talk to somebody as much as I did with you beforehand. On the same day. Not even the same day. We're talking like three hours. Literally, it's funny. This is a hilarious and awesome social experiment. I picked him up from his hotel and I just like harassed him all day to hang out with me. And then here we are. Now I love it. Um, I was secretly recording the whole time. Just saying I'm just kidding. Uh, anyway, so what was the question the? Yeah, so the interesting thing is uh with beast burger and feastables that um, there's physical goods as opposed to like making mobile games or PC game, which everyone we end up doing which is software and I actually have a giant international audience like um Most of my audience is obviously outside of America. And so the problem we're running into is it just takes time to build up the supply chain and get festivals in Southeast Asia, get festivals in India, get festivals in Brazil and Mexico and all these other places where we have giant pockets of our audience. And same thing with Beesper. It's just, it's going to take probably years, unless we partner with someone who already has a distribution, which we're figuring out. But the beauty of software is I can make a hypothetical game or whatever we end up doing and all my fans can use it tomorrow, the day I mentioned it. And so if I promote something in a video to 100 million people and it's basically like a game, they can all download it. But if I promote a Feast Rules Bar, right now it's only in America because we're struggling just to keep up with American demand. We haven't even gotten the chance to go outside America. So I alienate a majority of my audience and it feels sort of shitty to just mention something that most of them can't buy. But on the flip side, you can't just spawn this crazy infrastructure and just have tens of millions of bars and all your products in every single store across the world before you promote it. So you can't put the egg before the chicken. And so it's like that's what I'm excited about. I want to get into less physical stuff and more stuff that everyone might actually use. Especially if there's a social element to the gaming too. Because it's not unlike Feastable, it's like that's a product you consume. You missed it. When you're setting up for this, we were doing some basically just laying out everything that we're planning for. So our enthophases were we're want to start hiring the team to build it. And we're kind of just laying out the game. And I was actually really curious to get your thoughts. But I I can't say it because whatever I say someone's just gonna take it and run with it. But you're a good idea about the kind of games. Yeah, you're thinking about yeah, I mean I can imagine we also talked a little bit about it. It's super awesome. Good one. I did so much good talks. All right, the juicy talks happened. She's like, I gotta go set up. Well, you know, I already heard a lot of awesome. I mean, but that is a different kind of team you need to hire. Yeah, is that a little Never acting like going into a new field and trying to a little bit But then I remind myself like like Steve Jobs didn't know how to code right and you know He just just knew what a good product was and I feel like that's only wasted so much of his life playing video games Have a good sense of it and that might be ignorant. Well, that's the really important right? It's not about coding is about what makes for a good game Exactly, and again, I might genuinely be ignorant. So maybe I end up, you know, getting bin the button because of what I'm saying now, but I think just like with YouTube, I just want to obsess over making a great product and things that I think my audience will love. And I think as long as I keep that as my North Star, it'll do well. What is the path to being worth a hundred billion look like? There's a path to being worth a hundred billion look like. I don't know. Okay, let me just like pause your 24 and there's so much awesome scaling. So many great ideas. Do you think about different trajectories? Yeah, what those possible trajectories might look like Yeah, I mean if the goal was to just be worth hundred billion dollars. Yes. I mean I'm my goal I'm a broken record to make the best video possible because I know whatever else I want will come obviously The video is the foundation. Yeah, exactly. So to a path to a hundred billion dollars is just keep getting 100 million views of video, you know what I mean? Or more. Yeah, or more, exactly, if we can keep growing. But if we can keep Feastables growing, right, and we eventually spend an international one day, we're in 100,000 retail locations and we're selling the same amount of skews per, or units per skews like we're currently doing, I mean, that would crush. And then obviously, ideally, one day we open up hundreds of Beast burgers, we get it where we churn out like Supercell, a couple of hit games. I don't want to make dozens or hundreds of games. I just want to make games that are just great. And we rarely drop them while we do their bangers. And just whatever other stuff we end up doing, all that combined. It's just interesting because what's a show that's pooled 100 million views per episode basically like we're doing? You know me like the Super Bowl gets praised because they get 100 million viewers, but I can't think of a show Maybe in reruns or something. So it's also a show that has a has a singular kind of figure Yeah, you can now use as a like I don't have a network. Tell me what to do I don't have anyone like I can do whatever one so it's a very interesting position because I put out content and 100 million people show up and then I also have a gaming channel I put out content and 15 million people show up and I react you know I put out content 10 million people show up and have a tick dog and I put out content and on average 20 million people show up and like and I so as long as I can keep that going and then we build these businesses it's like it's honestly pretty scary to see what will happen you know over the years because Feastable's launched you know last year 2022 so it's a relatively new thing and Beast where we just started scaling up the physical side and we haven't obviously even launched any mobile games yet. So I think I'm at the antivesis of it. I don't see a world where my YouTube channels are relevant in the next couple of years. I just this is what I live for. And so if I can keep that going and then really start to expand these businesses that leverage off of it, then yeah, I mean, hopefully there's a day one where I can give away a billion dollars in a video, honestly. Yeah, that would be one hell of a video. Let me ask you the ridiculous questions since you went from being broke to being rich although you keep spending all your money does money buy happiness how has money changed sort of your oh man your happiness in life it's money by happiness um no not I mean to a point yes once you can take care of your health, you can take care of like any immediate dangers and you can take care of your family relatively. No, it doesn't like, but those things do like when I first came into money, one of the first things I did was retire my mom and like that brought me tons of happiness. You know what I mean? And like, you know, if my brother had a medical emergency and we couldn't afford it and I made money to afford it, that brings tons of happiness. You know, so once you take care of those basic necessities, so we'll say makeover,$5 million. No, it really doesn't. Adding an extra zero, going from $10 million to $100 million or whatever it is makes no difference. So you're giving that or just fearless in spending the money? Yeah. Well, let me reframe. I guess it could for some people if you really, I don't know, you spent your whole life obsessing over cars, it probably would bring you a little bit of joy to buy a nice Lamborghini. I'm coming more from the frame of mind of entrepreneur, someone who's really obsessed with business building. For me and a lot of my friends and people I hang around, what brings us happiness is winning and building companies and changing the world. That is fun. It's a complex problem you can wake up every day and it gives you something to obsess over and devote your life to where it's just having money doesn't. One interesting question I have for you psychologically, because you Have become wealthy and because you give like part of your work is giving away a lot of money Do you find it hard to find people you can trust? Is it a question? Do people see you basically as a source of money as opposed to another human being? It's weird because you would think yes, but I feel like I also know the right places to look but yeah if I just walked into Target and tried to make friends with 10 random people of course you gotta you can kind of sense oh yeah you can sense the right thing in the heart yeah that's yeah it's so obvious so I don't even want to go into descriptions but but honestly a lot of my friends or like Chandler I played little league with him and Tyler the guy I mean I went to school with him. Chris, he was my first subscriber. Carl was here after we got big, but whatever. He's friends with the boys. And it is a lot of my closer friends, even like my YouTube friends, I knew before I was big. So maybe there is some merit to that. Maybe it is. I don't know. I've never really put too much thought into it. Maybe there's a reason I hang around a lot of these people I knew before I got big because it's much easier. And they help If you keep like your radar sharp of who can and can't be trusted because you know you can trust them. It's difficult when you become richer and richer and more powerful. Well, one thing you'll also find when you get richer, not even richer but more famous. One thing I thought is as I climbed this ladder of YouTube and got bigger, I thought there would be tons of people like me. People, like that take like the kamikaze approach to building a business. just throw all your money in it, you throw all your time, you throw all your energy, you throw everything. You're just like, fuck it. This is this arm dead. I thought there would be hundreds of me and there isn't. There isn't. I mean, there's like maybe one or two. And I talk to those motherfuckers every single day. I'm sick and tired of talking to them, but I love them. But it's just so interesting because like every level I got up, like I get a million subscribers, you're like, all right, where's all these guys million subscribers that are fucking psychopaths and then you know, you know, people become like conservative as they get, they get more especially as they get bigger. Yeah. And you know, 20 million subscribers 30, it's like every step of the way, it's like, I just got more and more lonely to be honest. So do you, you know, it sounds cliche and you hear that kind of shit in movies and you're like, Oh, that's not how it works. But it is like, there's, there's just Not many people that just want to give up everything go all in then obsess over making the greatest goddamn videos every single day of their life Like they're really hard to find and be able to sacrifice Everything for that video. Yeah, basically you put all the money right back in yeah, or the people doing it They're on just a small scale and if I talked to them It's just 99.9 percent of the time I'm teaching them things and it's like so it's lonely because there's not too many people Especially in the creative space that is crazy as you. Yeah, it is 100% It's so it's not what I was expecting. I was expecting there to be a lot of people like me But well, I guess the guy we talked to you on musk is a bit like you in that sense. Yeah, just a different domain Yeah, exactly just willing us to put it all back in right now That's why I found right now a lot of the people I relate to don't even make YouTube videos like, I'm veering more and more away from fellow content creators and more to just, you know, I'm just looking for those other people who just share a little bit of it. So I don't feel so fucking crazy all the time. Like, you know what I mean? And like people I feel normal around and they tend to just be doing the randomest things, but, you know, loving it. Well, I think that's really inspiring. It's, it's like the Bukowski line, find what you love and let it kill you is really put everything put everything into the thing you love. That's like the way to really create special stuff, but it's also the way to live out the life. You have to be careful given this advice because they're like they're like bodybuilders. So it'll be like, just go to the gym, be disciplined. I'm disciplined, go to gym. But I would argue for those people, it's like, it's not even discipline. They just enjoy weightlifting, right? Because there are people who are jacked, but they don't make much money or run a business, right? If they're that disciplined, they would be hitting every area of their life. They just really like business. And there's people like me who just to an extreme level love building companies, right? It's not even disciplined for me. It's just in my blood. It's what I wake up. I don't think about it. I don't push myself. I don't need to watch a fucking motivational video to go work. I just do it. It's programmed in me at this point and I couldn't imagine a world where I don't wake up and do it every day But I think that a little bit of it is genetics and just how you're hardwired Not that it can't be trained or taught and not that you know and obviously the friend group you're in influences these things and over time I think can change it but Someone's just not gonna be able to flip a switch and then just start doing a combination a your mental health? Did you accept to protect it to, uh, yeah, to like for the long run to make sure you have the mental strength to go on? Yes, weirdly enough, the best thing for my mental health was giving into my nature to work. And the most depressed I get is when I try to restrict it and like, I don't work weekends or I don't work this day. What's best for me is just to work when I feel like working. And then just not work when I don't like and just have no constraints because there are just some nights where I don't want to sleep and for whatever reason I feel compelled to go all night Whatever like just do it. You know do whatever you want is what I tell my like Working brain and I just give into it. I feel that's where I feel the happiest and and then you know, it's typically like but when I'm really in the grind mode, it'll be like seven or eight days and just non-stop going going and it's like I'll realize like oh I need some recharge time and then go fucking binge it a season of anime. Yeah but listen to your body. But that's the thing like people will tell you don't work weekends or don't do this or don't work past this or blah blah give you all these constraints but for me and it's unconventional I just give into it. I think there's something really to be said for that. I try to surround myself with people that like when I don't when I pull an all-nighter they don't go like you should get more sleep there's a reason I pulled that all-nighter like if I'm really passionate about something they say they basically encourage it because I have no problem getting sleep and getting rest what I need in my life is people that encourage you to kind of keep going keep going with the stuff you're passionate about normal people they don't want that life and they probably shouldn't it's not good for you. But yeah, if you hang around people, like just whatever, different people, you're going to feel crazy and it's going to wear on you. Whereas if you're around similar people, it just it's so much easier. Like if you, you know, I've started weightlifting more and like one thing that's helped is just having Jack people around because they naturally just eat healthier. They do like they naturally just have freaking grilled chicken and all this shit and high protein meals. And it's just like easier for me to just piggyback and be like, Oh, can you just order me whatever you're getting? And they're like, Oh, I got to go to the gym. And I'll be like, Oh, shit, I'll just join you. You know, and it's like, it's just, it's cheat codes, you know, just surround yourself with people that you want to be. And it makes it like 70% easier, in my opinion. It's like, that is the cheat code to life. And I wish I obviously your audience is definitely a lot older. But you know, to the older people listening, like if you have are in a place of mentorship for someone younger or have influence over younger people, you should really try to drill that in their heads. Like the people are they around 100% dictates the outcome. I would not be on 120 million subscribers if I didn't find when I was around a million, I had a couple of friends that were just also psychopaths, you know, I outgrew them. But at the time it was And I wouldn't be where I am today if it wasn't for them. And just all along the way, the friends that I hung out with had such a dramatic impact on where I am. Like I probably have 80 million less subscribers. You know, if it was, if I wasn't so strategic about hanging out with people that I had value to and they also had value to me. So the advice for young people would be to be very selective about the people you saw. selective. It's crazy. Chris, he's really funny and that's why he's great for the videos. And part of why he's so funny is he consumes copious amounts of cartoons and just funny content. And so I'll find when I spend more time with Chris, I'll start just quoting these weird cartoons and shows. And my speech will literally change. And just after a week of spending more time with him, it has It's like that quick out of effect. Now picture that over the course of years. Yeah, it has such a huge influence. You pluck one of their friends out and hypothetically put me in there. There's no doubt if they're trying to become a content creator, their odds of success is 10x. Obviously, you can't do that, but you got to find your closest version of it. It should be selective. Yeah. But this also applies not to see younger, older people too. agree with it. It's even more, I like when I was a teenager, I just, you know, I couldn't relate to many people. I just thought it was like a freaking nature because no one was obsessed with building businesses or any of this kind of stuff. And so like back then, you know, that advice would have been helpful, maybe not that particular, but just knowing that there are, you know, it's not that you're a freaking nature, you just haven't found people that have the same interest. So the task is not to feel sorry for yourself or somehow change yourself it's more to find the find people you fit in with yeah I mean assuming which you know you're not getting compliment like I assume it's not something bad if you're hobbyist shooting things or shooting things you shouldn't be shooting you know don't find people that encourage that but outside of that for sure actually as an answer to what is the best advice advice that whenever gave you said you're crazy until you're successful then you're a genius 100% all along the way people gave me so much You know advice on why shouldn't be doing that why I'm crazy every step of the way people wanted to tell me why I shouldn't be doing this and should get alive should Stop being too obsessed everything everything under the book and then once I'm successful those same people are like dang You're genius. Wow, you really, you pull that off. Those are probably the same people that will give you advice now. You're the most successful video creator of all time. Stick to that. Anytime you want to do something new, right? They'll like pressure you not to do, you know, feastables or mobile gaming or whatever lays beyond. It's funny how people don't well honestly the type of people I just don't talk to anymore I wouldn't even know what they have to say now so most people on the team are like yes and they're like whatever the idea you got they they're with it no it's weird we actually have a my team pushes back on me pretty hardcore which I want I don't want yes man and they're like uh they're James you know the CEO who helped me build all this. He's very adamant. Like we're not yes men and and he trains people to really think for themselves and even when I give them orders like really think like is this optimal? Is there context or information Jimmy could be missing that I can provide that could help them make a more updated decision? Like I'm not God, you know what I mean? Like I'm human and I make errors and so don't take what I say as the Bible. So even like in the brainstorming and so on they can they can Yeah, you can see it like Tyler anytime I said something he would give me feedback and push back which is what I want I don't want him just to be like yes, you're fucking good job Jimmy. You know, I don't need that, you know, I need negatives You talked about being in a relationship what role Jimmy does love play in the human condition I think Well, the thing is it's love can be scary because this is you know the human you're gonna spend the most amount of time with in your life you know and so for project that over 50 years they can be a liability or an asset love the metrics you know love no but seriously it's gotta be someone that makes you better for me I can't truly love someone that doesn't make me better because yeah in the long run yeah across across because if not then it's like it's a negative you know it to everything I've spent my life building but luckily I'm very happy with the part I haven't like we were talking about before. I do think she makes me better. There's a lot of actually positives I've noticed even things as simple as like, you know, I struggle to turn off my brain at night because I'm just thinking about all the businesses and how we could do better or whatever weird thing I have on my mind. But you know, just chatting with her and hanging out with her helps me like basically just shut my brain off and like mellow out and even like there's just a ton of little things like that that I've noticed are our positives, especially when you really look for them that are easy to gloss over if you're not. And so for me, yeah, I have someone who I think is very beautiful, very intelligent, makes me better. He's constantly pushing me, okay with me working hard, makes me smarter and just all these different things that I think for me love just makes me a better person, you know what I mean? Which makes me love her even more. Does that make sense? Absolutely. What advice would you give on finding something like that? Just really don't give up until you find someone that you know, there's so many people on the planet. I mean there really is. There's billions of- The odds are in your favor. Yeah, like just don't settle and find someone that you know makes you happy. Yeah, just like you said surround yourself with people that make you a better person in the same case Surround yourself with that one special person that really makes you a better person And maybe that's just an entrepreneurial brain looking at it not everyone wants to hyper-optimize their life like me But for me to like truly love someone they have to make me a better person in every way. Yeah. Yeah Well, what do you hope you're 24 we thought we started talking about death. Let's let's Let's finish talking about death. What do you hope your legacy is? When you look a hundred years from now and the alien the AI has completely taken over and the aliens visit and discuss with the AI what this last of special humans that existed on earth was like what do you hope they say about you? It's a deep one probably just that Because it's it's hard right like I said before Elon is over double my age I could live every second I've lived up to this point in my life and still not even be on stage So I have so much time. I just hope whatever it is that it's a net positive on the world and an impact billions of people in a positive way that makes lasting change. So you admire people like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk for having sort of reached for that goal as well? Yeah, of course. To help millions. I mean the iPhone is the most successful product ever invented. It's hard not to admire what he created. The same with sort of as Johnny I've talked about like the the passion the effort they put into the designing the iPhone that like little bit of love is transferred to the whole world like they get the experience the joy of that from the designer. It's what a beautiful thing to do, you know, I mean I couldn't think of anything better, you know to create something that even after you're dead for decades just has such a profound impact on basically half the human population Yeah, it's wild brings joy to people Yeah, well, I hope you do just that man You've already done it for millions and millions and millions and millions of people and I hope you keep doing it I'm excited. I can't like it's so exciting to see what happens this year and next year. I know like I'm excited to limit. Yeah, I can't I mean The videos but ever all the other businesses you're in and you as a human being as you grow and Yeah, I can tell I know as everyone knows you have a kind heart and the fact that you're really damn good at Actually using that kind heart to help a lot of people. It's awesome to see man. I appreciate more importantly before we go Are we gonna play a dune tonight some board games gonna play doing after you don't want one hour You don't want to play board games with me. I want to play board games. You know what we're games If only I wasn't an idiot and actually flew to the right airport. If you don't have board games with me, they're gonna dislike the video.
