    "text": "The following is a conversation with Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, the company behind GPT-4, JADGPT, Dolly, Codex, and many other AI technologies which both individually and together constitute some of the greatest breakthroughs in the history of artificial intelligence, computing, and humanity in general. Please allow me to say a few words about the possibilities and the dangers of AI in this current moment in the history of human civilization. I believe it is a critical moment. We stand on the precipice of fundamental societal transformation where soon nobody knows when but many including me believe it's within our lifetime. The collective intelligence of the human species begins to pale in comparison. by many orders of magnitude to the general superintelligence in the AI systems we build and deploy at scale. This is both exciting and terrifying. It is exciting because of the innumerable applications we know and don't yet know that will empower humans to create, to flourish, to scale the widespread poverty and suffering that exists in the world today and to succeed in that old, all-too-human pursuit of happiness. It is terrifying because of the power that superintelligent AGI wields to destroy human civilization, intentionally or unintentionally. The power to suffocate the human spirit in the totalitarian way of George Orwell's 1984."
