It's a system that we'll look back at and say it was a very early AI and it's slow, it's buggy, it doesn't do a lot of things very well, but neither did the very earliest computers and they still pointed a path to something that was going to be really important in our lives, even though it took a few decades to evolve. Do you think this is a pivotal moment? Like out of all the versions of GPT 50 years from now, when they look back on an early system that was really kind of a leap, you know, in a Wikipedia page about the history of artificial intelligence, which of the GPTs would they put? That is a good question. I sort of think of progress as this It's not like we could say here was the moment where AI went from not happening to happening and I'd have a very hard time like pinpointing a single thing. I think it's this very continuous"
