    "text": "The following is a conversation with MrBeast, the mastermind behind some of the most epic and popular videos ever made. And now, a quick few second mention of each sponsor. Check them out in the description, it's the best way to support this podcast. We got House of Mechadamias for a satiating and delicious snack, 8 Sleep for you guessed it, naps and better help for mental health. Choose wisely my friends. Snacks, naps or mental health. And now on to the full ad reads. As always no ads in the middle. I try to make this interesting but if you skip them please still check out our sponsors. I enjoy their stuff maybe you will too. This show is brought to you by House of Macadamias. It seems like it was just yesterday. that they became a sponsor and I became aware of their existence because before they became a sponsor they sent a giant box of delicious snacks and it seems just like it was yesterday that I ate all of those snacks over a period of a few days and Was a happier man for it this month I'm much stricter on my diet and trying to be much more responsible with my consumption of snacks. I think moderation is key for that. But in general, I think first of all, macadamia to me, I think is one of the more delicious nuts, but it is definitely the healthiest or at least one of the most healthy. I think it's pretty much the healthy. I remember when I first started"
