And it's interesting. It's interesting to look at human history in the context of money. Can't we be patriotic and be pro-America, but like not want the petrodollar? Like I should be proud of my country. Why do we need to be propping up the Saudis? Why do we need to be, you know, threatening to invade other countries if they sell their oil for a different currency? I think we can be just as powerful as we are today, if not more powerful in a Bitcoin world. If you think about the infrastructure Americans are building, all the innovations we're building, all the wealth we have, I think we'll be fine, better than fine. And we won't have these horrible negative externalities. It's really an optimistic vision for the future. I thought we learned the lesson of 9-11 and the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan.

Well, I mean, that's like at least a good, this is the longest war, right? The forever wars. I feel like the past 20 years or whatever it is, 18 years, 19 years, we've been very skeptical about invading other countries. We've been skeptical about military intervention in other nations. Well, our leaders certainly haven't. We're at, what do we have, like seven active wars right now. And neither the Russians and the Chinese, everybody's starting to invade everybody else.

And all these, the real time strategy aspect is really stressful and computation, I'm sure, difficult. We'll get into it. But for me, Battle.net, so StarCraft was released in 1998, 20 years ago, which is hard to believe. And Blizzard Battle.net with Diablo in 96 came out. And to me, it might be a narrow perspective, but it changed online gaming and perhaps society forever. But I may have made way too narrow a viewpoint. And later on, as internet was starting to develop and being a bit faster and more reliable, then it's when I started experiencing Battle.net, which is this amazing universe, not only because of the fact that you can play the game against anyone in the world, but you can also get to know more people. You just get exposed to now this vast variety of it's kind of a bit when the chats came about. There was a chat system you could play against people. But you could also chat with people not only about Stalker, but about anything. And that became a way of life for two years. And obviously, then it exploded in me in that I started to play more seriously, going to tournaments, and so on and so forth. And I, at the time, was at Google Brain, which was in California. It's still in California. We had this summit where we got together, the two groups. So Google Brain and Google DeepMind got together. And we gave a series of talks. And given that they were doing deep reinforcement learning for games, I decided to bring up part of my past, which I had developed at Berkeley, like this thing which we call Berkeley Overmind, which is really just a StarCraft 1 bot. So I talked about that. And I remember Demis just came to me and said, well, maybe not now. It's perhaps a bit too early. But you should just come to DeepMind and do this again with deep reinforcement learning. And at the time, it sounded very science fiction for several reasons.\",\n",

Thank you for that question and the kind words. I changed my mind on a lot of things and I changed my mind all the time. I'm in a constant flux. I'm constantly learning. I guess my mind is a quantum mechanical system. But I can mention a few things that have been stable big shifts in my thinking, at least over the past year or two, especially related to the podcast. So on the topic of psychedelics, I've always found those fascinating. What I've changed my mind over the past couple of years is a hopeful message. I think that psychedelics can actually enter the realm of science and that there's a bunch of places that are starting to conduct large-scale research studies on psychedelics. And that's really exciting to me because I have a sense that that's just another perspective into the world of neuroscience that will help us understand the way the mind works and potentially how to engineer different aspects of what makes the human mind so special in our artificial intelligence systems. On the topic of social media, I've changed my mind over the past two years. I always felt that it had a bunch of complicated bad influences on society, but they were balanced with a lot of positive effects that build community. They give people a voice, all those kinds of things. More and more, I'm starting to think that the possible set of destructive trajectories that social media can take human civilization is much wider, much more destructive than I accounted for. So it's something that I worry about. In the space of existential risk of artificial intelligence that people talk about, I think my mind more and more over the past two years has been focused on social media as the greatest threat of artificial intelligence. I also think it's the greatest set of possibilities.\",\n",

I think you can enhance these games because your storytelling medium is so much more engaging. You know, I was at the movie theater before COVID and the person to the left of me was looking at their cell phone during the movie. And the person to the right of me was looking at their cell phone. They're just not engaged anymore. Everybody is attention starved. And the video game is one of the last mediums where you have undivided attention of people. They're really into it. They're all into that thing. And so I think the fact that you have VR and AR and enhanced graphics and all these new gameplay mechanics, it's a value add instead of a value negative. Because ultimately, what are you doing? You're telling stories and you're trying to connect people to something. Maybe it's the nature of life and death or are we truly real or are we in a simulation or not or something like it'd be great to do 13th floor as a game or something like that. And the question is, well, how good of a story can you tell? Well, you're constrained by your storytelling tools and technology. The fact that games are so much more advanced now means that you now have many more dimensions of storytelling available to you. And actually with AI now coming in and really good AI coming in the next five or 10 years, your storytelling is not static anymore. The person can actually majorly participate and change the outcome of it in ways that were previously unpredictable. The other thing is they're still educational. You can teach people concepts that they never knew before. And it's like, if you wanna teach people about bizarre geometries or like Minecraft is a great example. A lot of people learned how computers worked from redstone. Think about that. It's true. Yeah.\",\n",

That's where I could say we could have gone back and followed a path like that in the early days. If you just take the same game, whether it's when Activision demonstrated that you could make Call of Duty every year, and not only is it not bad, people love it and it's very profitable. The idea that you could have taken something like that, take a great game, release a new version every year that lets the capabilities grow and expand to start saying it's like, okay, it's a game about running around and shooting things, but now you can have... Bring your media into it. You can add persistence of social signs of life or whatever you want to add to it. I still think that's quite a good position to take, and I think that while Meta is doing a bottoms-up capability approach with Horizon Worlds where it's a fairly general purpose, creators can build whatever they want in their sort of thing, it's hard to compare and compete with something like Fortnite, which also has enormous amounts of creativity, even though it was not designed originally as a general purpose sort of thing. So we have examples on both sides. Me personally, I would have bet on trying to do entertainment, valuable destination first and expanding from there. So can you imagine the thing that will be kind of... And the memes with the dancing baby GIF or whatever the, all your base now belong to us, whatever those early memes that led to the modern memes and the humor on the different evolution of humor on the internet that I'm sure the historians will also write books about from the different website that support that create the infrastructure for that humor, like Reddit and all that kind of stuff.

       "  'text': \"Do you have a sense on a societal sociological level what's this whole part of society that many of us are not aware of? And it's a huge part of society, which is gamers. I mean, every time I come across that in YouTube or streaming sites, I mean, this is a huge number of people play games religiously. Do you have a sense of those folks, especially now that you've returned to that realm a little bit on the AI side? Yeah, so in fact, even after StarCraft, I actually played World of Warcraft, which is maybe the main sort of online worlds and presence that you get to interact with lots of people. So I played that for a little bit. To me, it was a bit less stressful than StarCraft because winning was kind of a given. You just put in this world and you can always complete missions. But I think it was actually the social aspect of, especially StarCraft first and then games like World of Warcraft, really shaped me in very interesting ways. Because what you get to experience is just people you wouldn't usually interact with. So even nowadays, I still have many Facebook friends from the area where I played online. And their ways of thinking is even political. They just don't, we don't live in it. We don't interact in the real world, but we were connected by basically fiber. And that way, I actually get to understand a bit better that we live in a diverse world. And these were just connections that were made by, because I happened to go in a city, in a virtual city as a priest, and I met this warrior and we became friends. And then we started playing together. So I think it's transformative and more and more people are more aware of it. I mean, it's becoming quite mainstream. But back in the day, as you were saying, in 2005 even, it was still a very strange thing to do, especially in Europe. I think there were exceptions. Like Korea, for instance, it was amazing that everything happened so early in terms of cyber cafes.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"If we look back a couple of centuries from now and you think about the experiences that marked the singularity, the transition where most of our world moved into virtual reality, what do you think those experiences will look like? So I do think it's going to be kind of like the way the web slowly took over, where you're the frog in the pot of water that's slowly heating up, where having lived through all of that. I remember when it was shocking to start seeing the first website address on a billboard, when you're like, hey, my computer world is infecting the real world. This is spreading out in some way. But there's still, when you look back and say, well, what made the web take off? And it wasn't a big bang sort of moment there. It was a bunch of little things that turned out not to even be the things that are relevant now that brought them into it. So... Well, I wonder if from, I mean, like you said, you're not a historian. So maybe there's a historian out there that could really identify that moment, data-driven way. It could be like MySpace or something like that. Maybe the first major social network that really reached into non-geek world or something like that. I think that's kind of the fallacy of historians though, looking for some of those kind of primary dominant causes where so many of these things are like, we see an exponential curve, but it's not because like one thing is going exponential. It's because we have hundreds of little sigmoid curves overlapped on top of each other. And they just happen to keep adding up so that you've got something kind of going exponential at any given point. But no single one of them was the critical thing. There were dozens and dozens of things. I mean, seeing the transitions of stuff like as obviously MySpace giving way to other things, but even like blogging giving way to social media and getting resurrected in other guises and things that happened there.\",\n",
