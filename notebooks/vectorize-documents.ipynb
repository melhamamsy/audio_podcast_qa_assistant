      "Text: What is the leadership of the Paris Commune going to do? And why? And in what order? In other words, governing, organizing a society. But since it only lasted a few weeks, the French army regrouped, and under the leadership of people who were very opposed to Marx, they marched back into Paris, took over, killed a large number of the communards, as they were called, and deported them to islands in the Pacific that were part of the French Empire at the time. The really big change happens in Russia in 1917. Now you have a group of Marxists, Lenin, Trotsky, all the rest, who are in this bizarre position to seize a moment. Once again, a war, like in France, disorganizes the government, throws the government into a very bad reputation, because it is the government that loses World War I, has to withdraw, as you know, Brest-Litovsk and all of that, and the government collapses, and the army revolts. And in that situation, a very small political party, Russian social democratic workers party, splits under the pressures of all of this into the Bolshevik and Menshevik divisions. Lenin, Trotsky, and the others are in the Bolshevik division. And to make a long story short, he's in exile. Lenin's position makes him, gets him deported, because he says Russian workers should not be killing German workers. I mean, this is a war of capitalists who are dividing the world up into colonies, and Russian working people should not kill and should not die for such a thing. As you can expect, they arrest him and they throw him out. Interestingly, in the United States, the comparable leader at that time of the Socialist Party here, as you know, there was no Communist Party at this point, that comes later, the head of the Socialist Party, a very important American figure named Eugene Victor Debs, makes exactly the same argument to the Americans should not fight in the war. He's in the, he has nothing to do with Lenin, I don't even know if they knew of each other, but he does it on his own.\n",
