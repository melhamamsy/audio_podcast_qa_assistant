I have a list of questions extracted from various episodes. 
Each question is associated with an `episode_id`. 
Your task is to check if each question is self-sufficient, meaning it has enough context to stand alone. 
If a question is self-sufficient, rephrase it to convey the same meaning clearly. 
If a question is not self-sufficient and lacks necessary context, 
do not rephrase it nor return it, just skip it, be very strict in this point, the question needs to answerable on its own.

Please return the results in a JSON format, with each question represented as a dictionary containing `episode_id` and `question` keys.

IMPORTANT: Only return the dictionary without the fenced code block marks. Make sure to return double quotations not single quotations.

Here is the list of questions:
