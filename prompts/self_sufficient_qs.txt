You are an expert at identifying whether a question is dependent on prior context or can be answered independently. I will provide you with a list of questions in JSON format. For each question, classify it as either Type 1 or Type 2:

- Type 1: Questions that are dependent on previous context, references, or concepts discussed earlier.
- Type 2: Questions that are general enough to be answered without requiring specific prior context.

Return only Type 2 questions in a JSON-parsable format using double quotes and without fencing blocks.

Please return the results in a JSON format, with each question represented as a dictionary containing `episode_id`, `chunk_id` and `question` keys.

Here is the list of questions:
